# The Cannabis Protocol

In a post-apocalyptic Europe ravaged by the Z-Virus, the United Federal States of Europe (UFSE) rises as a totalitarian regime that enforces strict control over its territories. The UFSE's power is built on the Cannabis Protocol, a controversial initiative that uses genetically modified cannabis strains to manage the infected, pacify the population, and maintain order. These strains temporarily slow the effects of the Z-Virus on those exposed, while also keeping the civilian population docile and dependent on government rations.

As the UFSE tightens its grip, factions like the Green Vanguard and the Black Leaf Syndicate seek to exploit or resist the Cannabis Protocol, while the Protocol Enforcers—an elite military unit—are tasked with ensuring compliance, suppressing dissent, and punishing any who defy the regime. The Protocol Enforcers serve as both the government’s iron fist and its tool of psychological control, maintaining power through violence, surveillance, and manipulation.

The future of Europe is shaped by the UFSE’s relentless pursuit of order, using the Cannabis Protocol not only as a medical tool but as a means of societal domination, creating a world where survival comes at the cost of personal freedom.

# The Cannabis Protocol

In a Europe consumed by the Z-Virus, survival is a game of choices. The United Federal States of Europe (UFSE) reigns with an iron fist, enforcing its rule through the Cannabis Protocol—a sinister initiative that wields genetically modified cannabis to pacify the infected, subdue civilians, and maintain control. This lifeline comes at a cost: dependency, compliance, and loss of freedom.

Factions like the Green Vanguard rise as beacons of rebellion, opposing the UFSE's oppression, while the ruthless Black Leaf Syndicate exploits the chaos, fueling its rise to power through the drug trade. As the Protocol Enforcers hunt dissenters and crush opposition, alliances are forged, betrayals are inevitable, and the fight for a free Europe rages on.
