# The Rise of the Cannabis Protocol: A New Hope, or a Dangerous Game?

## The Outbreak: A World on the Brink of Collapse

The world as we knew it ended in 2022. What started as an isolated viral outbreak in Eastern Europe soon spiraled out of control, consuming entire cities and nations. The infection—later identified as the Z-Virus—transformed ordinary people into ravenous, mindless creatures known simply as the Infected. Governments fell. Society fractured. And the world plunged into chaos.

Traditional methods to fight the outbreak failed. The military’s attempts to contain the infection were futile, and cities fell one by one. Hope dwindled as the infected hordes spread across the globe, leaving behind nothing but empty cities and the desperate few who managed to survive.

## The Discovery: A Green Solution

In the ashes of civilization, one breakthrough emerged—an unlikely ally in humanity’s fight for survival: Cannabis.

In the early days of the outbreak, as the government struggled to find effective treatments, a team of scientists and biochemists working under the United Federal States of Europe (UFSE) began experimenting with alternative medicine. A group led by Dr. Eva Volkov, a biochemist specializing in plant-based compounds, made a stunning discovery: Cannabis, particularly strains rich in cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), seemed to have unique neuroprotective properties.

Research indicated that when consumed, cannabis altered the neurological pathways in humans, not only delaying the onset of infection but even preventing full zombification in some cases. Cannabinoids were shown to reduce brain inflammation caused by the Z-Virus, effectively "locking" the virus in a dormant state. This led to the development of the Cannabis Protocol, a government-backed initiative to cultivate, refine, and distribute cannabis-based treatments to survivors.

## The Cannabis Protocol: Humanity’s Last Hope

By 2023, the Cannabis Protocol had become the cornerstone of the UFSE's counter-offensive against the infected hordes. The government embarked on a covert campaign to plant vast hemp fields, harvest and refine the potent cannabis strains, and distribute them under strict control.

Cannabis became the most valuable substance in the world. Those who consumed it, especially in the form of tinctures, oils, and concentrated pills, found themselves better able to resist infection, regenerate lost cognitive functions, and even manage the psychological trauma caused by the collapse of society.

The "Protocol Enforcers"—a paramilitary force tasked with securing hemp fields, refining facilities, and distributing the Cannabis-Cleanser to key survivors—were the most powerful faction in the world. But the government couldn't control everything. The infected continued to rise, and human greed and desperation led to criminal factions seizing the hemp fields and black-market cannabis trade. What was once seen as salvation became a resource war, with various groups vying for control.

## The Factions: A Divided World

Despite the success of the Cannabis Protocol in slowing the infection, not everyone agrees on how it should be used—or who should control it. As the world splintered into factions, the Cannabis Protocol became a powerful and controversial asset.

### The United Federal States of Europe (UFSE)

- **Goal:** Use cannabis to preserve humanity, distribute treatments, and keep order.
- **Leadership:** A coalition of government officials and military commanders. The UFSE maintains strict control over the cultivation and refinement of cannabis.
- **Strength:** Well-organized, heavily militarized, and technologically advanced, with a network of secure facilities and checkpoints.
- **Reputation:** While seen as a potential savior by some, others view the UFSE as authoritarian, hoarding life-saving resources for the elite and restricting access to the general population.

### The Green Vanguard

- **Goal:** Protect the cannabis fields, promote the widespread use of cannabis, and support sustainable agriculture as a means of survival.
- **Leadership:** Led by charismatic environmentalists, doctors, and survivalists, the Green Vanguard believes in decentralizing cannabis production and distribution.
- **Strength:** Expert growers, herbalists, and survivors who rely on guerrilla tactics and their knowledge of the land.
- **Reputation:** Viewed as freedom fighters by some, but radicals by others. They fight for the belief that cannabis can save the world—if distributed equally.

### The Black Leaf Syndicate

- **Goal**: Control the cannabis trade and exploit it for profit, creating black-market variants of the cannabis treatment.
- **Leadership**: Comprised of ruthless drug barons, opportunistic warlords, and former criminals. They seek to monopolize cannabis distribution, manufacturing dangerous, high-potency drugs from the cannabis strains.
- **Strength**: Well-connected in the underworld, with a network of smugglers and mercenaries.
- **Reputation**: Feared and hated for their exploitative methods, but they control a significant portion of the cannabis trade and are willing to do whatever it takes to stay in power.

### The Infected

- **Goal:** To spread the infection and annihilate humanity.
- **Strength:** Overwhelming numbers, unrelenting hunger, and the ability to adapt to the environment.
- **Reputation:** Nothing more than a mindless, monstrous threat to all survivors, yet their numbers continue to grow.

## The Struggle for Control

As cannabis becomes the most valuable resource in this new world, survivors are forced to make difficult choices. Will they align themselves with the UFSE for the promise of stability and protection? Will they fight with the Green Vanguard for a more egalitarian world where cannabis is distributed freely? Or will they turn to the Black Leaf Syndicate, embracing the chaos and profiting off the scarcity of this life-saving substance?

But even within these factions, there are questions about the long-term effects of cannabis. Is it truly a cure, or just a temporary fix? Can cannabis provide permanent immunity, or is it simply prolonging the inevitable collapse? As survivors venture into the infected wastelands in search of cannabis fields, hidden labs, and rare strains, they must confront not only the undead but the moral dilemma of whether humanity’s salvation lies in the green herb—or if it has become just another tool of control.

## The Future: A Flicker of Hope

The world teeters on the edge of oblivion. The infected grow in number, and the war over cannabis continues to escalate. Rumors speak of new, more powerful strains being developed in secret government labs—strains that could either save or doom the last remnants of humankind.

Some survivors believe that the government is withholding the full truth about the cannabis protocol. Others think it may be too late for any cure. But for now, the hope for survival is tied to this green plant, and factions fight and die for control of it, while the infected grow ever closer to consuming what little remains of the world.
