The Protocol Enforcers are an elite, fearsome faction within the United Federal States of Europe (UFSE), tasked with ensuring the strict compliance and implementation of the Cannabis Protocol and other government mandates. They are the shadowy enforcers of the UFSE’s laws, and their role is critical in maintaining the regime’s control over the population. Below is a more detailed expansion on their origins, structure, purpose, and operations.

The Protocol Enforcers: Guardians of the Cannabis Regime
Overview:
The Protocol Enforcers are a specialized, highly trained force within the UFSE, formed to uphold the laws and mandates related to the Cannabis Protocol and ensure complete compliance throughout UFSE-controlled territories. Their role extends beyond the mere enforcement of drug laws—they are tasked with ensuring the total domination of UFSE's governance, from surveillance and rationing to the suppression of dissent and rebellion.

They are both feared and respected, operating with brutal efficiency and a near-constant presence in the regions under UFSE control. The Enforcers are given the power to intervene in almost every aspect of the civilian population's life, from administering Cannabis Protocol doses to punishing any individuals found in violation of UFSE decrees.

Known for their unquestionable loyalty to the regime and their willingness to enforce the most draconian measures, the Protocol Enforcers are the face of UFSE authoritarianism. They maintain control through a mixture of military might, psychological manipulation, and sheer terror.

Origins of the Protocol Enforcers:
The Protocol Enforcers were born in the chaotic aftermath of the early days of the Z-Virus outbreak. As the UFSE government struggled to control the spread of the infection and the increasingly volatile civilian population, they needed a force that could keep the citizens in check, ensure the smooth distribution of Cannabis Protocol strains, and eradicate any resistance to the regime’s authority.

Creation and Founding:

In the initial years following the outbreak, Supreme Chancellor Wilhelm Adler recognized that the Cannabis Protocol would be a key to maintaining control over the population. However, it quickly became clear that simply distributing the cannabis wouldn’t be enough—there had to be a heavy, visible presence to ensure compliance.
Thus, the Protocol Enforcers were established as a paramilitary force composed of soldiers, scientists, and civilians loyal to the UFSE. Their primary task was to ensure the strict regulation of cannabis use and the maintenance of the Cannabis Protocol. Those who showed signs of resistance, misused the cannabis, or were found engaging in illegal cultivation were swiftly dealt with by this elite force.
Early Operations and Expansion:

Initially, the Protocol Enforcers were a small unit that operated in a few key cities. They were responsible for enforcing curfews, monitoring cannabis rations, and dealing with black market dealings. However, as the influence of the UFSE grew, so too did the power of the Enforcers.
They quickly expanded, with different squads established to cover specific functions, from military-style suppression of civil unrest to medical oversight of cannabis distribution. In time, the Protocol Enforcers became a key instrument of UFSE authority, feared for their brutal tactics and unquestionable loyalty to the regime.
Structure and Hierarchy:
The Protocol Enforcers are organized into a rigid military hierarchy, with specific divisions focused on different aspects of their mission. The leadership is centralized but allows for tactical flexibility in the field.

Supreme Commander of the Protocol Enforcers (SCP):

The highest-ranking officer in the Protocol Enforcers, the SCP is directly appointed by Supreme Chancellor Wilhelm Adler. This individual is responsible for all Enforcer operations and reports directly to the UFSE’s central command.
The current SCP is General Viktor Klein, a cold and calculating strategist known for his brutal efficiency and complete dedication to the regime. Under Klein's leadership, the Enforcers have become a symbol of UFSE’s absolute power.
Specialized Divisions:

Cannabis Enforcement Division (CED): This division is responsible for the distribution and regulation of cannabis within UFSE-controlled territories. Members of the CED patrol Cannabis Distribution Centers, ensure that citizens are receiving their rations, and monitor individuals for signs of misuse or resistance. The CED also oversees the Cannabis Re-Education Centers, where those caught abusing cannabis are sent for “treatment.”
Suppression and Punishment Division (SPD): This division is tasked with handling dissidents and any groups that refuse to comply with the Cannabis Protocol. They are often called in to deal with black market cannabis operations or insurgent factions, using violent force when necessary. The SPD’s signature tactic is public "Cannabis Trials," where individuals accused of violating the Cannabis Protocol are tried and executed in front of crowds to reinforce the regime’s power.
The Virus Control Unit (VCU): This elite division is focused on controlling the spread of the Z-Virus within UFSE territories. The VCU handles the infected populations, ensuring that the Cannabis Protocol’s S-1 strain is administered to those showing early signs of infection. They also patrol quarantine zones, keeping infected individuals from escaping and spreading the virus.
Re-Education and Psychological Operations Division (RPO): This division specializes in mental reprogramming and psychological warfare. They work to break the spirits of dissidents, ensuring they either comply with the regime or become incapable of rebellion. The RPO is known for its brutal use of Protocol S-3 (the hallucinogenic strain) to disorient and confuse prisoners and resistors, often using forced druggings to manipulate individuals into betraying their comrades.
Rank Structure:

Commander (Cdr): Senior field commanders responsible for overseeing large regional operations. They report directly to the SCP and manage multiple divisions.
Enforcer Captain (Capt): Mid-level officers who command specific teams, typically in charge of individual Cannabis Enforcement or Suppression squads.
Lieutenant (Lt): Junior officers responsible for tactical decision-making within squads. Lieutenants are often in charge of monitoring civilian compliance with cannabis distribution or leading raids against non-compliant groups.
Enforcer (Enf): The standard rank for all Protocol Enforcers, these soldiers and agents are highly trained operatives who carry out the majority of on-the-ground work. They are feared for their brutality, as they have been conditioned to suppress any form of resistance through overwhelming force.
Training and Conditioning:
To become a member of the Protocol Enforcers, candidates undergo a grueling selection and training process designed to weed out any signs of weakness, hesitation, or independent thought. The UFSE does not simply want soldiers—they want unquestioning servants of the regime.

Selection Process:

Candidates are chosen from a pool of UFSE loyalists, often from military backgrounds or even civilians who have shown exceptional loyalty to the UFSE government. They are put through intense psychological testing to ensure their loyalty and ideological purity.
The process includes a brutal series of physical and psychological endurance tests, including survival training, urban warfare tactics, and intensive indoctrination into UFSE doctrine. Potential Enforcers must prove they can operate without question, even under extreme pressure or in morally dubious situations.
Psychological Reconditioning:

Once selected, new recruits are subjected to a form of psychological reconditioning that breaks down their identity and replaces it with a single, unified purpose: serving the UFSE and enforcing the Cannabis Protocol.
The process includes intense mind manipulation, using techniques such as sensory deprivation, constant surveillance, and the Protocol S-2 cannabis strain to induce a sense of loyalty and subservience. The recruits are exposed to hallucinatory simulations of potential "dissent" and rebellion, forcing them to view such acts as treasonous.
The reconditioning is complete once the recruit is branded with a unique, serial-like identifier that marks them as an official Protocol Enforcer.
Field Training:

Enforcers undergo live-action training in urban zones, wilderness environments, and infected territories. They learn to operate under the worst possible conditions, fighting both the infected and hostile human factions. Their training includes:
Combat and Suppression: Enforcers are highly trained in hand-to-hand combat, firearm usage, and special tactics designed for suppression and intimidation.
Cannabis Distribution and Enforcement: Enforcers are trained to deliver cannabis doses, conduct drug tests, and enforce rationing protocols. They are often deployed to confiscate illegal cannabis and dismantle black market operations.
Interrogation and Psychological Warfare: Members of the RPO Division specialize in psychological warfare techniques, manipulating individuals’ fears and breaking down resistance through mental reconditioning or force-feeding Protocol S-3.
Tactics and Operations:
The Protocol Enforcers use a combination of militarized tactics, psychological warfare, and surveillance to carry out their duties. Their operations are carried out with ruthless efficiency, and they are feared for their willingness to act without mercy.

Surveillance and Control:

Enforcers work in tandem with UFSE surveillance systems, including drones and informants, to monitor civilian activities. They track any suspicious behavior related to cannabis misuse, black market dealings, or attempts to evade rationing.
Canvassing Operations: They conduct door-to-door checks of citizens’ homes, ensuring that Cannabis Protocol doses are being used properly and that there are no illegal drugs being cultivated.
Public Trials and Executions:

The Protocol Enforcers are known for publicly executing those who violate the Cannabis Protocol in brutal, public demonstrations. These "Cannabis Trials" are often held in the town squares, with the Enforcers showcasing the power of the UFSE government by punishing offenders in front of the terrified populace.
Raids and Suppression:

The Enforcers specialize in suppression raids against dissident groups or factions that defy UFSE control, such as the Green Vanguard or The Black Leaf Syndicate. They are armed with advanced weaponry, including flamethrowers, armored vehicles, and chemical agents to neutralize insurgents, rogue civilians, or any threat to the Cannabis Protocol.
The Future of the Protocol Enforcers:
As tensions rise between the UFSE and rebel factions, the role of the Protocol Enforcers becomes increasingly critical. Their power is likely to expand as more regions fall under UFSE control and the regime seeks to solidify its dominance over the population. The Enforcers will continue to serve as both the government's fist and its face of terror, ensuring that any attempts to disrupt the Cannabis Protocol are quickly stamped out with extreme prejudice.
