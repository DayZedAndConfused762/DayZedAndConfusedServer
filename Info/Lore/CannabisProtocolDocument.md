THE CANNABIS PROTOCOL
Official Directive and Operational Manual

Issued by: Minister Katrin Krüger
Date: August 14, 2024

I. INTRODUCTION
In response to the global Z-Virus pandemic and the failure of conventional medical approaches, the Cannabis Protocol has been developed as a critical initiative to slow, control, and eventually eradicate the threat posed by the virus. The Protocol consists of genetically engineered cannabis strains designed to modify the neurological impacts of the virus, mitigate its effects on survivors, and ensure compliance among the population. The Cannabis Protocol is a multi-faceted strategy encompassing medical, psychological, social, and military uses, each tailored to different facets of the ongoing crisis.

II. OBJECTIVES OF THE CANNABIS PROTOCOL
The Cannabis Protocol serves the following primary objectives:

Biological Control:
To slow the progression of the Z-Virus in exposed individuals, halt neurological degradation, and prevent the full zombification of infected survivors.

Medical Intervention:
To stabilize survivors, enhance immune functions, and provide temporary relief from infection-related symptoms, allowing individuals to maintain cognitive functions.

Psychological Pacification:
To reduce anxiety, depression, and societal unrest through regulated, state-controlled distribution of cannabis products, fostering dependence and ensuring social stability.

Military Advantage:
To use cannabis strains as psychological warfare tools against insurgent factions, dissidents, and enemies of the regime.

III. STRUCTURE OF THE CANNABIS PROTOCOL
A. Cannabis Strains
The Cannabis Protocol comprises three main strains, each genetically engineered for a specific function:

Protocol S-1 (Infection Stabilizer):
A strain developed to halt or slow the progression of the Z-Virus in exposed individuals. Its neuroprotective properties help stabilize brain function temporarily, delaying full infection and zombie transformation. This strain is used primarily in military and quarantine zones.

Protocol S-2 (Compliant Strain):
A strain designed for civilian use, primarily aimed at maintaining calm and reducing anxiety within the population. Protocol S-2 helps reinforce loyalty to the UFSE and keeps the general populace docile and compliant. It also has mild neuroprotective properties, although its primary function is psychological pacification.

Protocol S-3 (Hallucinogenic Strain):
A highly potent, experimental strain that combines the calming effects of S-2 with extreme hallucinatory properties. Protocol S-3 is used as a weapon against dissidents, rebels, and enemy factions, disorienting them and causing confusion, paranoia, and hallucinations.

B. Production and Distribution
Centralized Production:
Cannabis cultivation takes place within government-controlled facilities, where strict oversight ensures the purity and potency of each strain. All cannabis used for Protocol S-1, S-2, and S-3 is processed and refined to exact specifications in secure laboratories.

Distribution Control:
The UFSE has established Cannabis Distribution Centers across its territories to regulate the distribution of Protocol strains. Citizens are required to register for access and are assigned rations based on their loyalty to the regime, occupation, and health status. Distribution centers are heavily guarded by military personnel, and loyalty checks are mandatory to ensure compliance.

Loyalty Cards:
Citizens who show consistent loyalty to the UFSE are issued a Loyalty Card, which grants them access to regular doses of Protocol S-2. Doses of Protocol S-1 are administered to individuals at risk of infection, and Protocol S-3 is reserved for punitive measures against non-compliant individuals or enemy factions.

C. Experimental Strains and Future Development
The UFSE is currently conducting research into the development of Protocol S-0, an ancient strain that is rumored to have superior neuroprotective properties, capable of offering true immunity to the Z-Virus. The development of Protocol S-0 is top priority and is being pursued in secret labs located within UFSE-controlled zones.

IV. IMPLEMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL USE
A. Military Application
Protocol S-1 is distributed to UFSE military forces operating in contaminated zones. Soldiers are equipped with S-1 as part of their standard issue medical kits, enabling them to neutralize infected prisoners for interrogation or use them in biological warfare experiments.
Protocol S-3 is deployed in the field during operations against enemy factions. It is used to sabotage enemy morale, create confusion, and neutralize resistance by inducing hallucinatory states in targeted populations.
B. Civilian and Population Control
Protocol S-2 is the primary tool used to maintain public order. Citizens are required to consume regular doses of S-2, which helps to quell public dissent, reduce anxiety about the ongoing crisis, and enforce loyalty to the regime.
Those who refuse to comply or show resistance may be sent to Loyalty Rehabilitation Centers, where they are subjected to further doses of Protocol S-3 until they break.
C. Black Market Suppression
The government maintains a strict surveillance and enforcement system to eliminate illegal cannabis production and distribution. Those caught with unregulated strains or cultivating cannabis without permission are subject to arrest, interrogation, and possible execution. Cannabis Enforcement Squads are deployed to disrupt black market activities and maintain the dominance of the UFSE-controlled cannabis industry.

V. SOCIETAL IMPACT AND CONTROVERSY
A. Ethical Considerations
While the Cannabis Protocol has proven effective in stabilizing the population and halting the spread of infection, its long-term effects on the human psyche and society remain a matter of concern. Some within the UFSE government, including Minister Katrin Krüger, advocate for further experimentation to unlock the full potential of cannabis strains, while others voice concerns about the implications of a population so dependent on government-sanctioned substances.

B. Resistance and Rebellion
Factions such as the Green Vanguard and the Black Leaf Syndicate view the Cannabis Protocol as a tool of oppression and control. The Green Vanguard seeks to decentralize the production and distribution of cannabis, believing that it should be shared equally among all survivors, while the Black Leaf Syndicate profits from illegal cannabis trade and exploits the scarcity of the resource. Both factions present a direct threat to the stability of the UFSE’s control over cannabis.

VI. FUTURE DIRECTION
As the UFSE continues to refine the Cannabis Protocol, the possibility of a permanent cure for the Z-Virus remains a tantalizing goal. However, this future remains uncertain, and the Cannabis Protocol may evolve into an even more powerful tool of control—one that could ultimately define the future of humanity in a post-apocalyptic world.
