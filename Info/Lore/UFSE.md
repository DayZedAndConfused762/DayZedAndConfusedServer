This group plays a pivotal role in the world’s political structure, controlling resources, technology, and the remaining population under their rigid, militarized governance.

The United Federal States of Europe (UFSE): The Iron Grip of Order
Overview:
The United Federal States of Europe (UFSE) is a powerful and centralized government that emerged from the ashes of the old European Union following the outbreak of the Z-Virus. As the infection spread and society collapsed, the UFSE formed a unified, authoritarian state under the banner of "order through control." With a goal of stabilizing what remained of Europe, the UFSE saw themselves as humanity’s last hope for survival.

They implemented martial law across the continent, establishing a military-led government that has since grown into an empire of bureaucracy, surveillance, and heavy-handed repression. While the UFSE claims to protect the populace from the infected and restore civilization, their methods are draconian and oppressive. They exploit the outbreak to tighten their grip on power, creating a regime that controls all aspects of life—economic, political, and military.

The UFSE is driven by a belief that the world needs to be rebuilt, but only under their iron fist. They view the chaotic, lawless factions like The Green Vanguard and The Black Leaf Syndicate as threats to the fragile order they've constructed, and their ultimate goal is to unify Europe under their banner, with themselves at the top.

Core Beliefs:
Authoritarianism and Centralized Control:

The UFSE believes in a highly centralized, authoritarian state where the government has absolute control over every facet of life. They believe the survival of humanity depends on strict governance and control, and they are willing to use any means necessary to suppress dissent and enforce order.
The UFSE is fundamentally opposed to the idea of anarchy or decentralized power. They believe that the collapse of society was due to the failure of governments to maintain strict control, and they aim to prevent such chaos from ever happening again.
Survival through Order:

The UFSE holds the belief that without strong leadership and a unified vision, humanity is doomed. In their view, the Z-Virus is a punishment for mankind’s greed and corruption, and only through absolute order can Europe survive the apocalypse. The UFSE uses advanced surveillance, militarization, and rationing of resources to maintain their power, forcing civilians into submission for the "greater good."
They view the Z-Virus not only as a biological threat but also as a social one. Infected individuals are seen as the ultimate form of chaos—out of control, dangerous, and irrational. The UFSE works to eliminate this threat by any means, including forced quarantines, executions, and extreme isolation tactics.
Technological Superiority and Control of Resources:

The UFSE believes that technology is the key to restoring civilization. They use advanced research and surveillance technology to monitor both the infected and the survivors, and they have developed cutting-edge weapons and medical advancements to combat the Z-Virus. Their technological superiority is a cornerstone of their power.
The UFSE controls critical resources, including clean water, food, and cannabis (especially the government-controlled Cannabis Protocol). These resources are rationed and distributed strictly according to a person's status within the regime. Those who resist the government or fail to meet their standards of obedience often go without.
Paternalism and Sacrifice:

The UFSE promotes the idea of sacrifice for the greater good. Citizens are expected to submit to the government’s control in exchange for safety and security. The UFSE sees itself as the protector of the people, but the price is high. Dissent is not tolerated, and the UFSE uses public executions, forced labor camps, and surveillance to maintain conformity.
The UFSE’s leadership justifies their heavy-handed tactics by claiming that they are the only ones capable of ensuring survival in a world overrun by the undead. They believe that, if necessary, the needs of the many must outweigh the needs of the few—and this often means the loss of personal freedoms.
Structure & Leadership:
The leadership of the UFSE is highly structured, with a top-down, militarized hierarchy. At the top is the Supreme Chancellor, a position held by the ultimate ruler of the UFSE. Beneath them are various ministers and military commanders who oversee specific regions, operations, and enforcement of the government’s will.

Supreme Chancellor Wilhelm Adler:

Role: Supreme leader of the UFSE and the final authority on all matters of governance, military operations, and resource allocation.
Backstory: Wilhelm Adler rose to power as a member of the European Union's military leadership before the outbreak. During the early days of the Z-Virus, he saw the need for an authoritarian response to prevent the collapse of European society. His quick and decisive actions in suppressing riots and enforcing martial law helped him consolidate power, eventually leading to his appointment as Supreme Chancellor. Under his rule, the UFSE became a militarized state with one goal: survival through control.
Leadership Style: Cold, strategic, and authoritarian. Adler sees himself as a necessary evil—someone who has the intellect and resolve to maintain order in a world of chaos. He has little patience for dissent and views any form of rebellion as a direct threat to the survival of humanity. He has no qualms about using extreme measures to maintain his rule, including genocide or the mass extermination of infected.
Signature: Adler is rarely seen without his signature uniform, which combines elements of military dress and formal state attire. His stern, angular features are a symbol of his unforgiving nature, and he is often depicted with a monocle in one eye, symbolizing his constant vigilance.
General Lydia Volkov:

Role: The chief military commander of the UFSE’s forces.
Backstory: General Volkov was a decorated officer in the EU’s military before the outbreak and was one of the first to advocate for an organized, military-led response to the infection. She quickly rose through the ranks, known for her tactical brilliance and unwavering loyalty to the UFSE cause. Volkov now commands the Federal Protection Force (FPF), the UFSE’s elite military unit responsible for enforcing martial law, dealing with the infected, and eliminating opposition.
Leadership Style: Volkov is ruthless and pragmatic. While she commands respect from her troops for her military prowess, she is not afraid to make hard choices, including sacrificing civilians or soldiers if it serves the greater good. Her belief in the UFSE’s vision is absolute, and she views her actions as necessary to ensure the survival of Europe.
Signature: Volkov wears a pristine military uniform adorned with silver epaulets and medals, with her hair pulled back in a tight bun. She is often seen wielding a tactical rifle, symbolizing her direct involvement in the UFSE's most violent operations.
Minister Katrin Krüger:

Role: Minister of Science and Medical Affairs, responsible for overseeing research on the Z-Virus and the Cannabis Protocol.
Backstory: Minister Krüger was one of the leading virologists in Europe before the outbreak. She was recruited into the UFSE to head the government’s efforts to control the Z-Virus and develop a cure. Krüger is at the forefront of the UFSE’s use of cannabis as both a medicinal and biological tool, overseeing the development of the Cannabis Protocol, which is distributed to select UFSE citizens in an effort to slow the spread of the virus.
Leadership Style: Methodical and highly intelligent, Krüger is a scientist above all else. She believes in the power of research and experimentation to solve the world’s problems, often at the cost of ethics. While she genuinely believes in the UFSE’s mission, her single-minded dedication to scientific progress makes her willing to conduct controversial experiments—sometimes without the consent of the subjects.
Signature: Krüger is almost always seen wearing a white lab coat, with a long list of test tubes and medical vials at her side. Her sharp glasses and cold demeanor make her appear detached from the human cost of her experiments.
Tactics and Operations:
Martial Law and Military Enforcement: The UFSE maintains strict martial law across the territories they control. Military patrols are constant, and the public is closely monitored through surveillance drones and checkpoints. Those found guilty of defying the regime are swiftly executed or sent to labor camps where they are forced to work on government-controlled projects.

Cannabis Control and Research: The UFSE controls the production and distribution of cannabis under the Cannabis Protocol. They view it as a critical tool in both combating the Z-Virus and maintaining order. Citizens of the UFSE who are deemed "loyal" are given access to government-issued cannabis, but its use is strictly monitored. Those who misuse it, or attempt to produce their own, are swiftly punished.

Extermination of the Infected: The UFSE operates massive quarantine zones, often surrounded by large walls, where they contain infected populations. The UFSE doesn’t hesitate to deploy extreme measures to deal with the undead, using heavily armed military units to eliminate infected civilians and prevent outbreaks from spreading to secure zones.

Surveillance and Control: The UFSE utilizes advanced surveillance technology to monitor both the infected and the survivors. Drones, cameras, and informants are used to maintain complete control over their territories. Dissenters are tracked and silenced before they can become a threat to the regime.

The UFSE’s Vision for the Future:
The UFSE’s vision for the future is one of totalitarian stability. Under their iron fist, they believe they can restore Europe to a state of order, even if it means suppressing the very freedoms that once defined it. The regime’s goal is not to rebuild society in the image of the past but to forge a new Europe, one where survival comes at the cost of personal liberty. They will not stop until all of Europe is under their control, and their vision of a "perfect" world—founded on strict order and complete surveillance—is realized.
