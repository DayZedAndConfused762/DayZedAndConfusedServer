# Cannabis Protocol S-1 Strain: The Neurostabilizer

## Overview

The Cannabis S-1 Strain, also known as "Neurostabilizer", is the first and most vital creation of the Cannabis Protocol. Developed by UFSE scientists, this genetically modified strain is specifically engineered to counteract the effects of the Z-Virus in infected individuals. S-1 doesn’t cure the infection but provides a temporary reprieve, halting the progression of zombification and preserving cognitive function for as long as the treatment continues.

## Development

Created in the early days of the outbreak, S-1 was the result of extensive research into the neuroprotective properties of cannabis. By combining specific genetic modifications with high concentrations of cannabidiol (CBD) and a tailored blend of cannabinoids, the UFSE scientists produced a strain capable of directly interacting with the neural pathways affected by the Z-Virus. This interaction suppresses brain inflammation and restores limited control to individuals in the early stages of infection.

## Effects

When consumed, S-1 stabilizes the neurological degradation caused by the Z-Virus, providing:

- **Neuroprotection:** Slows the virus's spread through the brain, halting aggressive symptoms and delaying the loss of cognitive function.
- **Motor Control Restoration:** Partially restores fine motor skills, allowing infected individuals to move and act more like their pre-infection selves.
- **Cognitive Clarity:** Temporarily prevents the "mindless rage" associated with full zombification, allowing users to retain personality and decision-making abilities for a limited time.

However, S-1 is not without its limitations:

- **Temporary Relief:** Its effects last only 6-12 hours, requiring regular consumption to maintain stabilization.
- **Side Effects:** Users often report nausea, dizziness, and short-term memory loss, particularly with prolonged use.
- **Addiction Risk:** While not addictive in the traditional sense, reliance on S-1 to stave off full zombification creates a dependency that leaves users desperate for access.

## Medical Application

S-1 is administered as:

- **Tinctures:** Rapidly absorbed under the tongue for emergency stabilization.
- **Inhalants:** Used in battlefield settings for quick application to infected soldiers.
- **Capsules:** Designed for long-term management of infection in controlled environments.

## Strategic Importance

The S-1 Strain is one of the most valuable resources in the post-outbreak world. Its ability to extend the functional lifespan of infected individuals makes it indispensable for both military and civilian use. For the UFSE, it is a cornerstone of their control, with access to S-1 strictly rationed and distributed only to those deemed loyal.

## Uses in the Field

### UFSE Military Operations

Soldiers exposed to the Z-Virus carry S-1 as part of their standard survival kits, ensuring they remain combat-effective even after infection.
Captured infected are dosed with S-1 to study the virus or extract intelligence before they succumb.

### Civilian Stabilization

Survivors showing early symptoms of infection receive S-1 treatments to maintain their usefulness in controlled labor camps.
Key personnel such as scientists and engineers are often prioritized for long-term S-1 access.

### Black Market Trade

Due to its high value, S-1 has become a prized commodity on the black market. Rogue factions like the Black Leaf Syndicate produce unregulated knock-offs, though these are often less effective and more dangerous.

### Cultural Significance

Among survivors, S-1 is often called "Green Mercy" or "Zombie’s Last Chance" for its ability to stave off inevitable transformation. For the infected, it represents a fleeting hope to maintain their humanity. However, its scarcity and the UFSE’s strict control have also made it a symbol of oppression, with many factions fighting to gain access to the strain or develop alternatives.

## Warnings

The UFSE has issued stern advisories against overuse of S-1, as repeated administration can lead to irreversible neurological damage, addiction-like symptoms, and a phenomenon known as "S-1 Burnout," where the virus adapts to the treatment and renders it ineffective.

Cannabis S-1 is more than a strain—it is a lifeline in a world where survival is measured in hours and minutes. A marvel of scientific ingenuity and a weapon of social control, S-1 stands at the heart of the conflict between humanity’s salvation and its exploitation.

# Cannabis Protocol S-3 Strain: Kush

## Overview

The Cannabis S-3 Strain, known informally as "Kush", is the most volatile and weaponized strain in the Cannabis Protocol arsenal. Developed to disrupt enemy factions and punish dissent, Kush combines psychoactive and hallucinogenic effects with an unsettling ability to destabilize the mind. This strain, while deceptively mellow at first, induces paranoia, disorientation, and vivid hallucinations in those who consume it, making it a potent tool for psychological warfare.

## Development

Kush was engineered in UFSE labs as part of a classified project to weaponize cannabis. Unlike the medicinal or pacifying intentions of the S-1 and S-2 strains, Kush was created with a single goal: to incapacitate and disorient hostile targets. Its chemical profile enhances tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) levels far beyond natural limits, supplemented with genetically modified compounds that amplify its neuropsychiatric effects.

## Effects

The effects of Kush are highly unpredictable, varying based on the user’s mental state and environment:

- **Phase 1, Calm Before the Storm:** Initial consumption induces a sense of relaxation and mild euphoria, lowering defenses and encouraging trust.
- **Phase 2, Cognitive Collapse:** Within 15–30 minutes, paranoia begins to set in, accompanied by confusion and auditory distortions.
Hallucinations manifest as vivid, often nightmarish visions that play on the user’s subconscious fears.
- **Phase 3, Total Disorientation:** Users lose their sense of time, space, and reality, rendering them unable to act cohesively or defend themselves.
Severe cases result in psychotic episodes, violent outbursts, or emotional shutdown.
Long-term exposure or high doses of Kush can result in irreversible psychological damage, including chronic paranoia, delusions, and catatonia.

## Strategic Uses

Kush is a weapon of choice in scenarios where direct confrontation is too costly or impractical. Its unpredictable effects make it a double-edged sword, requiring careful deployment by UFSE operatives.

## Psychological Warfare

Kush is used to sow chaos and distrust among enemy ranks. Sabotaging food or water supplies with Kush ensures that hostile factions turn on each other in confusion and fear.
Deployed as an aerosol or smoke bomb in combat zones, it disorients opposition forces, making them easy targets for UFSE soldiers.

## Punitive Measures

Dissidents and rebellious individuals are dosed with Kush as a form of punishment. The resulting psychosis serves as a stark warning to others contemplating resistance.
Captives subjected to Kush often lose the will to resist interrogation, spilling critical information in a haze of confusion.

## Territory Neutralization

In contested zones, Kush is released into the environment to make the area uninhabitable for enemy factions. The strain’s effects discourage any attempts to establish a foothold, effectively turning the territory into a psychological minefield.

## Administration and Deployment

- **Consumption:** Kush is typically distributed as edibles, tinctures, or aerosolized vapors. The UFSE favors covert methods, ensuring targets consume or inhale the strain without realizing its effects.
- **Dosage:** Even trace amounts can trigger hallucinations, while higher doses guarantee a complete breakdown of cognitive function.
- **Delivery Systems:** Specialized drones or covert agents deploy Kush-laced products in enemy camps or civilian rebellion hubs.

## Warnings and Risks

- **Uncontrolled Spread:** Kush’s potency makes it a hazard if it spreads beyond its intended target. Civilian exposure is a constant risk in densely populated areas.
- **Collateral Damage:** Friendly operatives or agents in the vicinity of Kush deployment may experience its debilitating effects, requiring careful operational planning.
- **Black Market Exploitation:** Rogue factions like the Black Leaf Syndicate have been known to steal Kush supplies, weaponizing it for their own gain or selling it to desperate survivors looking for an escape from the horrors of the world.

## Cultural Impact

Among UFSE propaganda, Kush is known as "The Nightshade Bloom", an eerie reference to its capacity to plunge users into mental darkness. Survivors who’ve encountered Kush and lived to tell the tale often describe it as a "living nightmare", recounting stories of phantom enemies, shifting landscapes, and personal betrayals experienced during its effects.

## Future Applications

Kush remains under active research for even more insidious uses, such as enhancing its effects to target specific brain regions or embedding it with neural programming to condition behavior. UFSE scientists theorize it could one day serve as the basis for a "compliance serum," but these efforts are still in experimental stages.

## Conclusion

S-3 Kush is a testament to the UFSE’s ruthlessness, leveraging science not for salvation but for domination. As both a psychological weapon and a reminder of the regime’s reach, Kush ensures that resistance—whether military or civilian—comes at a high mental cost. In the shadow of its blue haze, enemies fall not to bullets, but to the terrors of their own minds.
