# The Cannabis Protocol: A Pillar of Control and Survival

## Overview:

The Cannabis Protocol is one of the most important, controversial, and closely guarded initiatives established by the United Federal States of Europe (UFSE) after the outbreak of the Z-Virus. Originally intended as a medicinal solution to combat the effects of the infection, the Cannabis Protocol has since evolved into a tool of both biological warfare and social control.

Through meticulous research and experimentation, the UFSE government discovered that certain strains of cannabis, when genetically modified and synthesized in controlled environments, had the ability to slow the progression of the Z-Virus in infected individuals and even offer a temporary reprieve from its symptoms. As a result, cannabis quickly became a critical resource, both in terms of medical usage and as a symbol of the UFSE’s dominance over the population.

The Cannabis Protocol involves the production, distribution, and regulation of genetically modified cannabis strains that are used for both medicinal and psychological purposes. Its distribution is tightly controlled, and access to it is a privilege granted only to those who remain loyal to the UFSE. However, the Protocol has darker implications, as it is also used as a means of pacifying the population, promoting dependency, and enforcing loyalty to the regime.

## The Origins of the Cannabis Protocol:

The Cannabis Protocol was first conceived in the early days of the Z-Virus outbreak when the UFSE’s scientific community began to examine potential ways to treat or slow down the spread of the infection. After several failed attempts with traditional medicines, an experimental group of UFSE scientists, under the leadership of Minister Katrin Krüger, turned to cannabis due to its historical use in pain relief, mental health treatment, and its properties as an immune system booster.

## Initial Discoveries:

Early trials on survivors and infected individuals showed that certain strains of cannabis could temporarily alleviate symptoms of the Z-Virus, particularly slowing the rapid neurological degradation that caused severe aggression and the loss of human cognitive functions. These strains were found to work by boosting certain neurochemical pathways, stabilizing brain function, and reducing the inflammation that the virus caused in the brain.

Some of these cannabis strains also exhibited strong anti-anxiety and calming properties, which helped keep civilians docile and manageable in the face of the constant threat of infection. This added a layer of social control for the UFSE, who were quick to realize the broader potential of cannabis beyond just medical use.

## Genetic Engineering:

The UFSE scientists began breeding and genetically modifying cannabis strains to enhance their medicinal properties, developing what became known as Cannabis Protocol Strains. These highly specialized strains were made for specific purposes:

- **Protocol S-1**: A strain that helped stabilize the neurological function of infected individuals temporarily, halting or slowing the physical mutation caused by the virus. It was primarily used to manage exposed individuals and keep the infected from deteriorating into full-blown zombies.

- **Protocol S-2**: A strain designed for the civilian population. This strain had calming, anxiety-reducing effects, and was used to control public sentiment, reduce resistance, and promote complacency. Those who were loyal to the UFSE would be given regular doses of this strain, which helped to reinforce their dependence on the regime.

- **Protocol S-3**: An experimental strain that combines the calming effects of the S-2 strain with potent hallucinogenic properties. This strain was intended to be used on enemy factions or dissenters, creating confusion, hallucinations, and psychological disarray to break down any resistance to UFSE control.

## Purpose and Function:

While the Cannabis Protocol was originally intended for medical purposes—offering hope for the survival of humanity in the face of the Z-Virus—it evolved into something far darker and more insidious. Here’s a breakdown of its key functions:

### Medical and Biological Use:

- **Slowing the Infection**: The primary medical application of cannabis within the Protocol is to slow the effects of the Z-Virus on survivors who have been exposed. While it does not cure the virus, it acts as a temporary stabilizer, allowing infected individuals to function for a limited time before they succumb to the virus. Some people who receive Protocol S-1 treatments are even able to lead a semi-normal life, albeit with limited cognitive functions.
- **Managing the Infected**: The UFSE uses cannabis in military operations to manage infected zones. Soldiers are known to carry Protocol S-1 as part of their standard medical kit, using it to keep infected prisoners from turning into full zombies for long enough to be interrogated or to study the progression of the disease.
Depression and Anxiety Relief: The Protocol S-2 strain is distributed to civilians who show signs of emotional instability or anxiety about the outbreak. This strain keeps the population calm, docile, and manageable, making it easier for the UFSE to maintain control over its citizens.

### Social Control and Compliance:

- **A Tool for Dependency**: One of the darker purposes of the Cannabis Protocol is its ability to create a population dependent on government-controlled cannabis. The UFSE carefully monitors its citizens’ access to the strain, ensuring that those loyal to the regime have access to the calming Protocol S-2 strain, while those who resist or dissent are denied it. Those who do not comply are often given "free doses" of Protocol S-3—a hallucinogenic and debilitating strain used to punish and break down rebellious individuals.
- **Pacification of the Masses**: By giving the population a legal, regulated form of cannabis, the UFSE pacifies its citizens while maintaining control over supply. Those who are allowed to use it become reliant on the government for their emotional stability and overall well-being. The psychological effects are often subtle at first, but prolonged use leads to a form of dependency where citizens will accept the UFSE’s oppressive rule in exchange for continued access to the cannabis strains.

### Political and Military Advantage:

- **Suppressing Dissent**: The UFSE uses the Cannabis Protocol as a tool for suppressing dissent within their borders. For example, any group or faction that resists UFSE control can be targeted with Protocol S-3. This strain induces paranoia, confusion, and hallucinatory states that make it nearly impossible for enemies to form coherent plans or organize an effective rebellion. Additionally, high-ranking UFSE officers use Protocol S-2 to keep their subordinates complacent and obedient, preventing insubordination and coups within the regime.
- **Targeted Deployment**: The Protocol is also used as part of the UFSE’s “psychological warfare” tactics. When dealing with factions like the Green Vanguard or The Black Leaf Syndicate, the UFSE sometimes uses specialized Protocol strains to sabotage morale or cause disorder within enemy ranks. If a target area is suspected of harboring dissidents or rebels, the UFSE might deploy a high dose of Protocol S-3 to incapacitate a community and disband their leadership.

### Control of Resources:

- **Cannabis as Currency**: Due to the importance of the Cannabis Protocol, cannabis itself becomes a valuable resource within the UFSE-controlled territories. While the cannabis produced by the UFSE is tightly regulated and only available to those loyal to the regime, those who can afford it use it as a form of currency. The state also makes use of cannabis as a tool to barter with other factions, such as the Black Leaf Syndicate, who are primarily motivated by profit.
- **Black Market Control**: Although the UFSE controls the legal distribution of cannabis, there is a thriving black market for unregulated strains, which some survivors use as a form of rebellion against the regime. However, these unregulated strains are often highly addictive and dangerous, leading to a constant struggle between the government’s desire for total control and the underground networks that seek to undermine it.

## Access and Distribution:

The distribution of Cannabis Protocol strains is a highly regulated process, controlled by the UFSE government through a combination of military oversight and bureaucratic systems:

### Government-Approved Distribution Centers:

The UFSE operates state-run Cannabis Distribution Centers where citizens are registered and assigned access to the Cannabis Protocol. Only those deemed “loyal” or “useful” to the regime are granted full access to Protocol S-2, while Protocol S-1 is only given to those who have been exposed to the virus and are showing symptoms.
The distribution centers are heavily guarded by UFSE soldiers, and citizens must present identification, undergo regular loyalty checks, and submit to health screenings to ensure they’re eligible to receive cannabis.
Loyalty Cards and Quotas:

Each citizen who receives cannabis must hold a Loyalty Card, which entitles them to a monthly or weekly ration of Protocol S-2. The amount allotted depends on the citizen’s occupation, status, and level of loyalty to the regime. Those who perform well in government-sponsored work programs or military service may receive higher doses.
For the population at large, rationing is key. Access to cannabis is limited to ensure only those loyal to the UFSE get adequate amounts. Dissenters or those who fail to meet the government’s expectations may see their rations cut off entirely, forcing them into a state of withdrawal or psychological breakdown.
Enforcement and Repression:

The UFSE enforces strict punishment for any illegal cultivation, smuggling, or possession of unregulated cannabis strains. Individuals caught producing or distributing unauthorized cannabis are arrested, interrogated, and often executed in public displays meant to reinforce the regime’s power.
Future of the Cannabis Protocol:
The future of the Cannabis Protocol remains uncertain. With increasing tensions between the UFSE and independent factions like the Green Vanguard and The Black Leaf Syndicate, the Protocol may evolve into an even more powerful weapon of control.

Some within the UFSE leadership envision using cannabis as part of a genetic engineering project to create a permanent cure for the Z-Virus. Others, like Minister Katrin Krüger, may see it as a tool to further their research into the virus and its long-term effects on humanity.

As more factions begin to seek out the Cannabis Protocol for their own purposes—whether for survival or as a form of rebellion—its role in the future of the world remains a key battleground for control over what remains of Europe.
