# The Rise of the Cannabis Protocol: A New Hope, or a Dangerous Game?

## The Outbreak: The Beginning of the End

The outbreak began as an isolated incident in a small, remote town in Eastern Europe. It quickly spread across borders, devastating entire cities, and leaving most of the world in ruins. The infection—later known as the "Z-virus"—turns people into mindless, ravenous creatures, hunting down the living without mercy.

As traditional methods to halt the outbreak failed, a desperate, fragmented government coalition known as The United Federal States of Europe (UFSE) and various national health agencies began looking for unconventional solutions.

## The Discovery: Cannabis as a Cure

In the early days of the outbreak, survivors and researchers noticed a peculiar trend: certain individuals who had regularly used cannabis prior to the outbreak seemed to display stronger cognitive functions and less aggression when bitten by the infected. Some of them even exhibited signs of partial immunity, with the infection progressing more slowly than in non-cannabis users.

As the UFSE's research divisions scrambled to find any possible edge in this new world of horrors, a breakthrough came from an unlikely source: Dr. Mira Konstantin, a renowned biochemist from a defunct university in the region. She theorized that certain compounds in cannabis—particularly CBD (cannabidiol)—had powerful anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties that could help combat the virus's rapid degeneration of brain tissue.

By carefully manipulating the genetic profile of cannabis plants, Dr. Konstantin's team succeeded in creating a hybrid strain of cannabis known as "Hemp-Sativa X-24" that exhibited not only neuroprotective properties but also increased resistance to the infection when consumed by humans. Early trials were promising, and the UFSE quickly seized upon this development as a last-ditch effort to reclaim control over the outbreak.

## The Cannabis Protocol: A Government Plan

By 2023, the Cannabis Protocol had become the cornerstone of the UFSE's counter-offensive against the infected hordes. The government embarked on a covert campaign to plant vast hemp fields, harvest and refine the potent cannabis strains, and distribute them under strict control.

Cannabis-Cleanser (a purified form of cannabis extract) became the most valuable substance in the world. Those who consumed it, especially in the form of tinctures, oils, and concentrated pills, found themselves better able to resist infection, regenerate lost cognitive functions, and even manage the psychological trauma caused by the collapse of society.

The "Protocol Enforcers"—a paramilitary force tasked with securing hemp fields, refining facilities, and distributing the Cannabis-Cleanser to key survivors—were the most powerful faction in the world. But the government couldn't control everything. The infected continued to rise, and human greed and desperation led to criminal factions seizing the hemp fields and black-market cannabis trade. What was once seen as salvation became a resource war, with various groups vying for control.

## Current State: A Fractured World

As the infection continues to spread, the government struggles to maintain its grip on the remaining pockets of civilization. While the Cannabis Protocol is hailed by some as humanity's last hope, others view it with suspicion. Some believe that the cannabis is merely a band-aid, staving off the inevitable decay of society without offering a true solution. Others suspect the government is using the cannabis to control the remaining population, keeping them docile and compliant.

Survivors now find themselves in a desperate race to find cannabis-based treatments before they are overwhelmed by the infection. In the wastelands, rumors circulate of hidden government labs where the hybrid cannabis strain is cultivated and refined into even more potent forms, but these locations are highly guarded by military forces and heavily infected zones.

Some factions, like the Green Vanguard, actively fight for control of the hemp fields, believing that only through the wide distribution of cannabis can they ensure humanity’s survival. Meanwhile, criminal gangs, like the Black Leaf Syndicate, engage in illegal cannabis trafficking, using the drug not just for medicinal purposes but also to create new, dangerous substances that might offer even greater resistance to the virus—or offer untold power to those who control it.

## Key Factions:

### The United Federal States of Europe (UFSE)

- **Goal:** Preserve humanity using the Cannabis Protocol, maintain control over cannabis production, and distribute the Cannabis-Cleanser.
- **Leadership:** A shadowy government coalition, represented by military leaders and corporate elites.
- **Strength:** Well-armed and disciplined, but scattered and with limited resources.
- **Reputation:** Seen as both a savior and a controller, the UFSE’s power is in constant flux.

### The Green Vanguard

- **Goal:** Protect and distribute cannabis as a means of salvation. They are environmentalists who believe in the healing power of nature and the cannabis plant.
- **Leadership:** Charismatic survivors who lead with a mix of idealism and pragmatism.
- **Strength:** Guerrilla tactics, deep knowledge of the land, and the ability to cultivate and produce cannabis.
- **Reputation:** Viewed as heroes by those who believe in the power of cannabis, but also as extremists by the UFSE.

### The Black Leaf Syndicate

- **Goal:** Exploit the cannabis trade for profit and control. They are ruthless in their pursuit of power.
- **Leadership:** A network of warlords, drug barons, and opportunistic survivalists.
- **Strength:** Highly skilled in illicit activities, including drug manufacturing and human trafficking.
- **Reputation:** Feared and despised by many for their brutal methods, but respected for their influence in the black market.

The Infected

- **Goal:** To spread the infection and annihilate humanity.
- **Strength:** Overwhelming numbers, unrelenting hunger, and the ability to adapt to the environment.
- **Reputation:** Nothing more than a mindless, monstrous threat to all survivors, yet their numbers continue to grow.

## The Survival Struggle:

In the post-apocalyptic world, survivors must balance their need for food, shelter, and weapons with their need for cannabis-based medicine. The best and most potent forms of cannabis are often found in government-controlled zones, now overrun by both the infected and rival human factions. While some survivors will risk everything for a chance to secure the medicine they need, others will try to avoid the chaos altogether, opting to live off the land or band together in small, isolated communities.

As factions vie for control over the cannabis, each survivor’s journey becomes a question of morality, survival, and hope. Will they work with the UFSE to ensure humanity's survival? Will they join the Green Vanguard in a bid to protect the planet? Or will they turn to the Black Leaf Syndicate for power and profit in this new world?

The future is uncertain. But one thing is clear: cannabis is not just a plant—it’s the key to life in a world on the brink of extinction.
