Overview:
The Green Vanguard is a radical faction that believes in the power of nature, especially cannabis, as humanity’s key to survival. They are environmentalists, survivalists, and idealists who see the world’s collapse as a direct consequence of human greed and environmental destruction. In their eyes, the cannabis plant isn’t just a medicinal resource—it’s a symbol of humanity’s last chance to reconnect with the earth and save what’s left of the world.

Where other factions rely on brute force, technology, and government control, the Green Vanguard believes in harmony with nature. They see cannabis not only as a treatment for the Z-Virus but as a catalyst for societal change. To them, the plant holds the promise of healing both the infected and the world itself.

Core Beliefs:
Cannabis as Salvation:

The Green Vanguard holds the firm belief that cannabis, especially the genetically enhanced strains derived from the Cannabis Protocol, is humanity’s greatest chance for survival. They believe the plant has the potential to cure the infected or, at the very least, slow the infection and help humans retain their cognitive abilities.
They are proponents of widespread cannabis cultivation and a decentralized, sustainable approach to farming. They oppose the government monopoly over the Cannabis Protocol, arguing that it should be a shared resource for all.
Environmental Reclamation:

The Green Vanguard sees the apocalypse not as the end, but as an opportunity to restore the earth to its natural balance. They are determined to heal the scars of industrialization, deforestation, and pollution, viewing the destruction of the old world as a warning of what happens when humanity loses its connection to nature.
They promote rewilding and sustainable farming, with a focus on planting not only cannabis but other crops that can help rebuild the ecosystem. They believe in the symbiosis of all living things, and see themselves as stewards of the land in this new, post-apocalyptic world.
The Fight for Freedom:

Unlike the UFSE and the Black Leaf Syndicate, the Green Vanguard rejects authoritarian rule and the commodification of cannabis. They believe the government’s monopolistic control over the cannabis industry is an extension of the same forces that led to humanity’s downfall.
They see their movement as a fight for freedom—not just from the infected, but from the oppressive systems that are trying to control what remains of civilization. They envision a world where communities can come together to heal, farm, and live in harmony with the land.
Structure & Leadership:
The Green Vanguard is loosely organized, with a decentralized structure that prioritizes autonomy and collective decision-making. Leadership is typically earned through merit and respect, with each cell or group of Vanguard members making its own decisions for the greater good of the movement. However, the organization does have a few key leaders who serve as influential figures within the group:

Elder Mara "Greenheart" Kovač:

Role: The spiritual and ideological leader of the Green Vanguard.
Backstory: A former botanist and environmental activist before the outbreak, Mara Kovač was one of the first to recognize the power of cannabis as a potential cure for the Z-Virus. She became a leader in the movement after the government seized control of the cannabis fields, and her vision of a society based on ecological restoration and equality resonated with survivors across the region.
Leadership Style: Charismatic, with a deep respect for nature and the earth. Mara prefers diplomacy and persuasion over violence, believing that the Green Vanguard should be a beacon of hope and unity in a divided world.
Signature: She’s often seen carrying a small, personal seed pouch—symbolizing the movement’s core belief in planting seeds of hope for future generations.
Rico "Redwood" Dávila:

Role: A former soldier turned protector of the Green Vanguard’s cannabis fields.
Backstory: Rico was a former mercenary who was hired to guard cannabis fields for private companies. After witnessing the UFSE’s corrupt use of cannabis as a control tool, he deserted his employers and joined the Green Vanguard. With his military training and experience, he became a key protector of the Vanguard’s assets and a strong voice for armed resistance against the UFSE and the Black Leaf Syndicate.
Leadership Style: Tactical and pragmatic. Rico is less concerned with idealism and more focused on practical survival. He believes the Green Vanguard must defend itself from hostile forces at all costs and is willing to use force to protect the movement’s goals.
Signature: Known for wearing a camouflage jacket adorned with patches of green leaves, symbolizing his loyalty to the Vanguard and the earth.
Lila “Seedling” Rojas:

Role: The Green Vanguard’s head of cultivation and agriculture.
Backstory: Lila grew up on a farm and became an expert in sustainable agriculture. After the outbreak, she took to the wilds, foraging and growing food for herself and others. Her work with cannabis cultivation, using old-world organic farming techniques, made her one of the Vanguard’s most valuable members.
Leadership Style: Hands-on and nurturing. Lila is practical and patient, believing that the key to saving humanity lies in the soil, seeds, and the slow restoration of natural balance. She trains new recruits in agricultural skills and works tirelessly to ensure that the Green Vanguard remains self-sufficient.
Signature: Often seen with dirt-stained hands and a wide-brimmed hat, symbolizing her dedication to the land and the cultivation of life.
Tactics and Operations:
Cannabis Cultivation: The Green Vanguard operates hidden farms in remote, hard-to-reach areas. They cultivate a variety of crops, with a focus on medicinal cannabis strains that can be used to treat both the infected and the survivors. They often use guerrilla tactics to protect their farms from raiders, rival factions, and the UFSE’s military forces.

Rewilding Initiatives: Beyond cannabis, the Vanguard works to restore ecosystems that were destroyed before the outbreak. They plant native species, clean up polluted areas, and set up animal sanctuaries. They have a network of naturalists who track wildlife and maintain safe zones for animals and plants to repopulate.

Rescue and Aid Operations: The Green Vanguard runs clandestine rescue missions for survivors trapped in infected zones. Their focus is on helping people escape the clutches of both the undead and the factions that would exploit them. They prioritize providing food, water, and cannabis-based treatments to those in need.

Guerrilla Warfare: While not a militaristic faction, the Green Vanguard has adopted certain elements of resistance warfare. They’ve organized ambushes against UFSE convoys, sabotaged the Black Leaf Syndicate’s trafficking routes, and protected vulnerable communities from both the infected and hostile groups. Their methods are often non-lethal, but they are more than capable of defending their own.

The Green Vanguard’s Enemies and Allies:
Enemies:
The United Federal States of Europe (UFSE): The UFSE represents everything the Green Vanguard despises—authoritarianism, control, and the commodification of natural resources. While the UFSE sees cannabis as a tool to control the population, the Green Vanguard believes it should be freely available to all, and they actively resist the government’s heavy-handed tactics.
The Black Leaf Syndicate: The Syndicate is a criminal network that has exploited cannabis for profit. They produce dangerous, unregulated versions of cannabis, often laced with harmful substances. The Green Vanguard views them as corrupt and dangerous, using the plant to fuel addiction rather than healing.
Allies:
Independent Survivor Groups: The Green Vanguard often partners with independent survivor groups who share their ecological values or have been directly aided by their cannabis-based treatments. They trade knowledge, supplies, and protection with these groups.
Other Eco-Factions: Some smaller eco-survivalist groups align themselves with the Green Vanguard, especially those that value sustainable living and environmental restoration.
The Green Vanguard’s Vision for the Future:
The Green Vanguard sees itself not just as a faction fighting for survival, but as the harbinger of a new world. A world where humanity learns from its past mistakes, reconnects with the earth, and rebuilds from the ground up. They believe that cannabis is the first step toward healing—not only for individuals suffering from the Z-Virus but for a planet that has been ravaged by human greed.

Their vision is a future where the land is respected, the people are free from oppressive systems, and the infection is not just fought, but truly understood and eventually cured. They dream of a world where nature is no longer a resource to be exploited, but a partner in humanity's survival.

In the shattered world of DayZ, The Green Vanguard is both a symbol of hope and a defiant challenge to the world that came before the outbreak. They fight for the earth’s future—one seed at a time.

This lore fleshes out The Green Vanguard as a complex and ideologically driven faction. Their mission is more than just survival—it’s about restoring balance, freedom, and ecological harmony in a post-apocalyptic world.
