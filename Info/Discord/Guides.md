# Base Building

## Territories

To maintain your base, you need to create a territory.  Create a regular flag pole, then walk up to it and press the option to create a territory.

Base building objects have a lifetime of 14 days, some storage and misc. objects have a lifetime of 10 days.  Be sure to keep your flag raised to prevent your base from despawning.
