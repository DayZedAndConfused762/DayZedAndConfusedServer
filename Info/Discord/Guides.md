# Base Building

## Territories

To secure and maintain your base while preventing others from building in the area, you must establish a territory. Start by placing a regular flagpole, then approach it and select the option to create a territory.

Base building objects have a lifespan of 14 days, while some storage and miscellaneous items last only 10 days. To prevent your base from despawning, be sure to keep your flag raised and territory active.

You can construct both Vanilla and Base Building Plus (BBP) objects. To build BBP structures, you'll need a BBP Blueprint. Combine this blueprint with planks to craft the BBP Workbench.

## Raiding

Raiding is a key activity in this environment, allowing you to break into other players' bases and steal valuable items or sabotage their operations. To carry out a raid, you can use explosives or specialized raiding tools designed to breach the defenses of enemy structures. However, the only way to gain entry into a base is through doors, meaning you must focus your efforts on bypassing the locked entrances, as walls and other barriers cannot be targeted directly.

There are several raiding tools at your disposal, each with unique capabilities to assist in breaking into secured locations. Raid drivers are used to force open doors, while raid saws allow you to cut through reinforced doors and gates. Hacking tablets can be employed to hack into electronic locks or security systems, offering a more technical approach to infiltration. These tools provide a variety of methods for raiders, allowing for different strategies depending on the situation and the strength of the target's defenses.

# Infected

# Weapons

You will find many different weapons across the map.

# Market

The Market consists of two separate trading areas, each controlled by a different faction. Each market offers a wide range of goods, from weapons and ammunition to tools and various equipment. The two factions oversee the transactions in their respective markets, ensuring the smooth flow of trade and maintaining control over the types of goods exchanged.

While most items can be bought and sold in the Market, certain goods are restricted. Food and medical supplies, for instance, are not typically available for trade, as these essential items are tightly regulated by the factions. This restriction ensures that basic necessities are conserved and distributed under strict control, preventing them from becoming commodities for profit.

## Green Mountain

Green Mountain is an outpost of the Green Vanguard located in the Chernarus region. It serves as a key base for the faction, providing military and logistical support to maintain control in the area. The outpost is well-secured and acts as a strategic hub for operations and supplies.

At Green Mountain, you'll find a variety of dated items and weapons, including older military equipment. These supplies are stored for the Vanguard's use or available for trade, making the outpost an important location for those seeking to acquire or exchange valuable goods.

## Black Market

The Black Market is operated by the Black Leaf Syndicate. It serves as a hub for a wide range of illegal activities, providing a space where illicit substances can be sold and traded.

In addition to contraband, the market is also a key location for the exchange of stolen UFSE arms and equipment. Valuable items of all kinds can be bought and sold here, making it a dangerous but lucrative place for those seeking to acquire or offload high-value goods.

# Bunkers

There are three bunkers scattered across the region, each requiring a specific series of punches on a punched card to access. These heavily secured locations are not easily infiltrated, and gaining entry to them requires precision and knowledge of the correct sequence. The bunkers can be found at key strategic points: Rify, Tisy, and the Northwest Airfield (NWAF). These locations are well-guarded, making the bunkers a high-risk, high-reward destination for those daring enough to attempt entry.

Inside the bunkers, youâ€™ll find some of the best loot available in the area, including rare weapons, advanced equipment, and valuable supplies. The loot found within these highly secure facilities is considered among the most coveted, drawing many to risk their lives for the chance to gain access. However, the bunkers are often closely monitored, and the path to securing their riches can be fraught with danger, requiring careful planning and skillful execution to succeed.

# Treasure Hunting

Treasure hunting in this world offers the thrill of discovery, as you explore the environment in search of hidden stashes, cash registers, and loot crates scattered throughout the landscape. These caches contain valuable items that can significantly aid in your survival, ranging from rare weapons to essential supplies. Some of these treasures are already unlocked and easy to access, while others are secured and require a bit more effort to obtain.

To unlock or break into these hidden spots, you'll need to use various tools or keys. Tools such as crowbars, lockpicks, and hammers can help you break into locked crates or cash registers, while keys might be needed for specific stashes or locked areas. The hunt for treasure is both rewarding and challenging, as it requires patience, skill, and sometimes even a bit of luck to find the hidden riches that await.
