# Base Building

## Territories

To maintain your base, and prevent others building, you need to create a territory.  Create a regular flag pole, then walk up to it and press the option to create a territory.

Base building objects have a lifetime of 14 days, some storage and misc. objects have a lifetime of 10 days.  Be sure to keep your flag raised to prevent your base from despawning.

You can build both Vanilla and Base Building Plus objects.  To make BBP objects you need a BBP Blueprint, combine this with planks to make the BBP Workbench.
