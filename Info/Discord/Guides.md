# Base Building !!!

## Territories

To secure and maintain your base while preventing others from building in the area, you must establish a territory. Start by placing a regular flagpole, then approach it and select the option to create a territory.

Base building objects have a lifespan of 14 days, while some storage and miscellaneous items last only 10 days. To prevent your base from despawning, be sure to keep your flag raised and territory active.

You can construct both Vanilla and Base Building Plus (BBP) objects. To build BBP structures, you'll need a BBP Blueprint. Combine this blueprint with planks to craft the BBP Workbench.

## Raiding

Raiding is a key activity in this environment, allowing you to break into other players' bases and steal valuable items or sabotage their operations. To carry out a raid, you can use explosives or specialized raiding tools designed to breach the defenses of enemy structures. However, the only way to gain entry into a base is through doors, meaning you must focus your efforts on bypassing the locked entrances, as walls and other barriers cannot be targeted directly.

There are several raiding tools at your disposal, each with unique capabilities to assist in breaking into secured locations. Raid drivers are used to force open doors, while raid saws allow you to cut through reinforced doors and gates. Hacking tablets can be employed to hack into electronic locks or security systems, offering a more technical approach to infiltration. These tools provide a variety of methods for raiders, allowing for different strategies depending on the situation and the strength of the target's defenses.

====================

# The Infected !!!

The Infected have evolved into diverse and unpredictable threats, each with unique strengths, weaknesses, and abilities. While many retain the classic traits of relentless aggression and speed, some have adapted in ways that make them even more dangerous. Certain Infected possess the strength to break down doors, forcing survivors to constantly reassess what constitutes safety. Their varied traits mean that no two encounters are the same, keeping survivors on edge as they navigate the dangerous wasteland.

Among the ranks of the Infected are rare and formidable "special" types, such as Priests and Terrorists. These variants are significantly tougher to defeat, often requiring advanced tactics or superior firepower. However, the challenge comes with rewards, as these special Infected are known to drop valuable loot that can be the difference between survival and death. Spotting and confronting them can be a calculated risk—but one that might pay off for those brave or desperate enough to take it.

====================

# Weapons !!!

Survivors will come across a wide variety of weapons scattered across the map, ranging from rudimentary firearms to makeshift tools of survival. Among these, the rare and advanced weapons developed by the UFSE stand out as highly coveted treasures. These cutting-edge tools of destruction offer unparalleled power and precision, making them a game-changer for anyone lucky—or daring—enough to acquire them. However, their scarcity ensures that finding them requires determination and a willingness to face danger.

For those hunting UFSE technology, there are several high-risk options. Dynamic Events often offer a chance to claim these advanced weapons, but they come with fierce competition and deadly stakes. Alternatively, survivors can delve into the perilous Bunkers, where UFSE tech is hidden amid hordes of Infected and other dangers. The Black Market is another avenue for acquiring these weapons, though the price is steep, and the dealings are shrouded in risk. Alongside these firearms, survivors can also discover improvised and enhanced melee weapons—brutal tools forged for those who prefer to fight up close and personal.

====================

# Market !!!

The Market consists of two separate trading areas, each controlled by a different faction. Each market offers a wide range of goods, from weapons and ammunition to tools and various equipment. The two factions oversee the transactions in their respective markets, ensuring the smooth flow of trade and maintaining control over the types of goods exchanged.

While most items can be bought and sold in the Market, certain goods are restricted. Food and medical supplies, for instance, are not typically available for trade, as these essential items are tightly regulated by the factions. This restriction ensures that basic necessities are conserved and distributed under strict control, preventing them from becoming commodities for profit.

## Green Mountain

Green Mountain is an outpost of the Green Vanguard located in the Chernarus region. It serves as a key base for the faction, providing military and logistical support to maintain control in the area. The outpost is well-secured and acts as a strategic hub for operations and supplies.

At Green Mountain, you'll find a variety of dated items and weapons, including older military equipment. These supplies are stored for the Vanguard's use or available for trade, making the outpost an important location for those seeking to acquire or exchange valuable goods.

## Black Market

The Black Market at Radio Zenit is operated by the Black Leaf Syndicate. It serves as a hub for a wide range of illegal activities, providing a space where illicit substances can be sold and traded.

In addition to contraband, the market is also a key location for the exchange of stolen UFSE arms and equipment. Valuable items of all kinds can be bought and sold here, making it a dangerous but lucrative place for those seeking to acquire or offload high-value goods.

====================

# Bunkers !!!

There are three bunkers scattered across the region, each requiring a specific series of punches on a punched card to access. These heavily secured locations are not easily infiltrated, and gaining entry to them requires precision and knowledge of the correct sequence. The bunkers can be found at key strategic points: Rify, Tisy, and the Northwest Airfield (NWAF). These locations are well-guarded, making the bunkers a high-risk, high-reward destination for those daring enough to attempt entry.

Inside the bunkers, you’ll find some of the best loot available in the area, including rare weapons, advanced equipment, and valuable supplies. The loot found within these highly secure facilities is considered among the most coveted, drawing many to risk their lives for the chance to gain access. However, the bunkers are often closely monitored, and the path to securing their riches can be fraught with danger, requiring careful planning and skillful execution to succeed.

====================

# Dynamic Events !!!

Beyond the usual events like helicopter crashes and convoys, survivors can stumble upon unique and dangerous Dynamic Events that add to the challenges of survival. UFSE checkpoints dot the map, serving as remnants of the regime's control efforts. These areas often contain valuable loot but are heavily guarded and fraught with danger. Additionally, the aftermath of terrorist attacks can be found, offering unique opportunities for scavenging. These sites hold rare resources, but their volatile history makes them unpredictable and perilous to explore.

A major threat within these new events is the presence of the special Terrorist Infected. Far tougher than standard infected, these formidable enemies test even the most experienced survivors. Their enhanced durability and aggression make every encounter with them a high-stakes battle, but the rewards they guard are often worth the risk. Proceed with caution—these encounters are as deadly as they are rewarding.

====================

# Treasure Hunting !!!

Treasure hunting in this world offers the thrill of discovery, as you explore the environment in search of hidden stashes, cash registers, and loot crates scattered throughout the landscape. These caches contain valuable items that can significantly aid in your survival, ranging from rare weapons to essential supplies. Some of these treasures are already unlocked and easy to access, while others are secured and require a bit more effort to obtain.

To unlock or break into these hidden spots, you'll need to use various tools or keys. Tools such as crowbars, lockpicks, and hammers can help you break into locked crates or cash registers, while keys might be needed for specific stashes or locked areas. The hunt for treasure is both rewarding and challenging, as it requires patience, skill, and sometimes even a bit of luck to find the hidden riches that await.

====================

# Vehicles !!!
In the post-outbreak world, vehicles play a crucial role in survival and exploration. In addition to standard civilian vehicles scattered across the map, you may come across abandoned UFSE military vehicles like the Pitbull and Dingo. These specialized vehicles offer superior durability and off-road capabilities, making them highly coveted by survivors. Vehicle keys can be found to secure your ride, but locks are not foolproof—skilled players with the right tools can pick locks and even change the keys, adding an extra layer of risk to vehicle ownership.

Fuel, however, remains a scarce and valuable resource. Every journey should be planned carefully, as the availability of fuel determines how far you can travel and how quickly you can escape dangerous encounters. Use your vehicles strategically, balancing the need for speed and protection with the ever-present reality of dwindling fuel supplies.
