Patch Date 08162024

Additions:
-NVG
    -UAPNVG Chimera "FOG_UAPNVG_Base" in Black, RG, and Tan
-Slot icons
-Vanilla Ghillie retextures made by Mr.Worldwide.
-Handlebar Beard (cosmetic, wont look great unless your character model already has a beard)

Changes: 
-All clothing and gear now have proper scritped inheritance. This wasnt an issue for normal use of the mod, however now it is possible for servers to mod specific clothing bases and include FOG items.
-Most items can now use the wring out action.
-FOG_GPNVG_Elite emissive can now be properly retextured
-Adjusted ce_radius memory point of most models. This is an attempt to reduce the ammount of spam seen from cle trying to spawn items but not having enough space. Some servers may benefit from this change, or it might do nothing at all. 
-Resized mustache to 2x2

Fixes:
-Fixed an issue with the ghillie suit disappearing after a certain distance. 
-Fixed default GlobalArmor properties for AVS and TacTec. 
-Fixed FOG_Tshirt_Red and FOG_Tshirt_Tan499 displaying each others textures.
-FOG Glasses should now block god rays, wont have any PPE effects.
