Changed: 
-Massive file reconstruction due to limited PBO size.
-Weight reduction on most items.
-Moves patches configuration to DATA for easier reskinning.
-Began moving pouches and Accessories to own folders. Will complete this move with the next update.
- FAST MT and SF now can take covers, and uses exclusion checks to ensure items cannot be attached at the same time.

Fixes:
-Should resolve the issue of players endlessly stacking pouches. NOTE: If you are changing the size of pouches in your own configs, you well negate the effects of this fix.
-ALL ITEMS/POUCHES/HELMETS can now be repaired using different repair kits that make sense for the item.
-Adds hidden selections to Open Coat fur for reskinning purposes.
