Simply repack the either BBP_Vanilla_Dmg.pbo or BBP_Vanilla_Dmg_Doors.pbo into your serverpack, if you want to use the default values.

BBP_Vanilla_Dmg = All parts can be destroyed with explosions!

BBP_Vanilla_Dmg_Doors = Only parts with doors, gates and hatches can be destroyed with explosions!

If you want to edit the hitpoints of each tier open the config.cpp and only edit the vaules that have //ONLY EDIT ME ((("hitpoints= "ADD YOUR DMG HERE"; //ONLY EDIT ME")))
then pack the mod and repack it into your serverpack.

If you know what you are doing you can edit other values if you desire!

==================================
Default Health Values of each tier!
T1 = 21,000
T2 = 10,000 (T1 + 10,000) = 31,000
T3 = 50,000
==================================

FYI: T2 is set to 10,000 since once T2 breaks T1 is still standing.

for reference the vanilla wood fence has a hitpoints value of 16000.

=== YES, you can still use breaching_charge mod, with vanilla damage enabled, so more raiding options for players! ===
