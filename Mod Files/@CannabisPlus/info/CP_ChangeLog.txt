v3.0.2
Fixes
- Machines remain locked if the server crashes or restarts while the workbench is running.
- Starting the workbench process if there wasn't enough battery energy or if the battery ran out of energy would keep the workbench in a running state until it was manually stopped.
- Processing weed doesn't subtract energy from the battery on the first baggy or brick.
- Bagger and Wrapper works in ruined state.
- If servers made logs stackable, disassembling the Drypost Kit would spawn a full stack of logs.
- Some backend stuff.

Known Issues
- Unwrapping a baggy or brick spawns a piece of paper.
- Can add raw plants to the Drying Post after drying process is started.
- Have to look at the base of the plant to Harvest it.
- Some sort of issue with not being able to water plants more than once per restart if server is using weather.cfg file.
- Cigarettes are still despawning.
- CP Pouch has some geometry issues.
- Rope poofs if dragged into dry post inventory.
- Rolling papers float if dropped on ground.
