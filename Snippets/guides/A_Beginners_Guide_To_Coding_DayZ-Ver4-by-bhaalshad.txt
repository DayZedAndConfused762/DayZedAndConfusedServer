#Helpful Tools

If you do not know where or how to get coordinates like X,Z I would suggest using the iZurvive DayZ Map Tool. 
It can be found here... https://www.izurvive.com/

A good editor program would be Notepad++
It can be found here... https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/
I would also install the validator and compare features. You can get info
on how to do this from our Tools section.

If you are looking for a building, but do not know the name I would suggest using
DayZ Interactive Loot Map which can be found here...  https://dayz.xam.nu/

*******************************************************************************
#Getting Started, Making Events

The first thing most people want to do is create events. 
So in this chapter we will go over the basics for doing this.

To create an event there are three main areas you will want to go over. 
The first is the spawn point (place you want the event to appear at).
This can be found in cfgeventspawn.xml
You will need to name your event so you can call it later. All event names
need to start with one of the following.

| Vehicle - any and all cars fit into this type
| Static - any and all buildings found in mapgroupproto.xml
| Loot - any and all items found in types.xml
| Item - any and all items found in types.xml
| Infected - Zombies fit into this type
| Animal - any and all animals
 example 
	<event name="StaticBuilding1>
		<pos x="11955.0" z="12550.0" a="113.000000" />
	</event> 
In the pos line you see three coordinates. X,Z,and A
The X & Z coordinates can be obtained from programs like iZurvive
The A coordinate is for rotation. This works on a 0-360. 
It is a good practice to have 6 digits after the decimal point 
to avoid the building from randomly rotating on restarts.

You can have multiple spawn points by simply adding more pos lines if you want the same object 
in more then one area.

What do you want to spawn in, well for that you can look in mapgroupproto.xml which list all the 
buildings and wrecks in the game. or maybe you want to spawn in an item, for that we look in types.xml
which list all the loot and items in the game. to find the class name of the object look at the beginning
of each you will see name=, the name after that is the class name and that is the name you will use in your
actual event as show below on the child line where it says type=.

Now for the actual event. For this we will need to open up the events.xml
Remember the custom name we set above, that will need to be used here so the two will work together.

For this example we will be spawning in a lamp post, you can ofcorse use any building.
    <event name="StaticBuilding1">
        <nominal>1</nominal>
        <min>1</min>
        <max>1</max>
        <lifetime>3888000</lifetime>
        <restock>0</restock>
        <saferadius>0</saferadius>
        <distanceradius>0</distanceradius>
        <cleanupradius>100</cleanupradius>
        <flags deletable="0" init_random="0" remove_damaged="0"/>
        <position>fixed</position>
        <limit>mixed</limit>
        <active>1</active>
        <children>
		<child lootmax="0" lootmin="0" max="1" min="1" type="Land_Power_Pole_Conc1_Amp"/>
        </children>
    </event>
** for definitions of each of the tags used above see #Definitions	

*******************************************************************************
#Spawning Items Anywhere
This is a little trick you can use to spawn your items in the air. You can even make it 
so it looks like the item is on a wall for example. To do this we will need to use a few files.
The first is mapgrouppos.xml This file is used to set the coordinates for the item(s).
You will need to use a custom name so it can be called later. For this example we will use
Gun1 as we will be spawning in a M4A1.

Example Using 1 Weapon
<group name="Gun1" pos="12156.0 140.400000 12627.00" rpy="-0.000000 0.000000 0.000000" a="0.0" />

Example Using 2 Weapons
<group name="Gun1" pos="12156.0 140.400000 12627.00" rpy="-0.000000 0.000000 0.000000" a="0.0" />

As you can see we have many coordinates listed. here is a break down of each one.

pos cords. 3 sets of numbers
1st = X cord
2nd = Elevation
3rd = Z cord

If you need to find the Elevation, there are 2 good ways you can do this.
1: have a friend hit you.
2: kill yourself in-game.
Both of these will show in your logs, which take about 5 minutes to register,
the order of the coordinates in the logs is like this :  X, Z, E.

rpy cords. 3 sets of numbers
1st = roll angle
2nd = pitch angle
3rd = yaw angle

After you have set your coordinates you can test to see if you need to alter it a bit to better fit what you
are going for. But before we can test we still need to add one more bit of code.

Open up the mapgroupproto.xml 
Remember the custom name we use above, that will be used here as well so the two can work together

Example Using 1 Weapon

<group name="Gun1" lootmax="1">
	<usage name="Military" />
	<container name="loot" lootmax="1">
		<category name="weapons"/>
	</container>
	<dispatch>
		<proxy type="M4A1" pos="-1.0 2.0 1.5" rpy="-225.0 90.0 0.0" />
	</dispatch>
</group>

Example Using 2 Weapons

<group name="Gun1" lootmax="2">
	<usage name="Military" />
	<container name="loot" lootmax="2">
		<category name="weapons"/>
	</container>
	<dispatch>
		<proxy type="M4A1" pos="-1.0 2.0 1.5" rpy="-225.0 90.0 0.0" />
		<proxy type="M4A1" pos="1.0 2.0 1.5" rpy="-225.0 90.0 0.0" />
	</dispatch>
</group>

Notice in the 2nd example we increased lootmax to 2 and in the dispatch area we now have 2 proxy lines.
The lootmax number needs to match the total of proxy lines (1 for each item to spawn).
In the pos coordinates we set the second weapon off a bit from the first so it spawns next to the first weapon.
Using this method you could use many items. Setting the lootmax to the total proxy lines etc.

By adjusting the Elevation coordinate you can make the item higher or lower, using the X and Z coordinate
you can adjust the position to get it to fit just how you want.

If you use any item from types.xml be sure to look to see what category and usage tag that it is
set to. The tags need to be listed above to make the match for the item(s) in question.

Using this method we can use anything from the types.xml pretty much. This method however does not work with buildings.

*******************************************************************************
#Changing - Adding Animal Spawns

There are two basic methods for spawning in animals. One is to have them spawn in without AI, thus making them
more like a pet. Can be used in a premade Zoo, just for esthetic's, or maybe just for a scare tactic lol.
The other uses the AI and thus will attack players if able.
The class names for animals can be found in types.xml
For this example we will be using a Bear.

For pet animals (No AI) ....

<!-- cfgeventspawns.xml New Entry -->
<event name="ItemAnimal1">
	<pos x="3872.40" z="10962.24" a="180.0" />
</event>
Replace the X and Z cords to an area you wish to see the bear at.

<!-- events.xml New Entry -->
    <event name="ItemAnimal1">
        <nominal>1</nominal>
        <min>1</min>
        <max>1</max>
        <lifetime>180</lifetime>
        <restock>0</restock>
        <saferadius>200</saferadius>
        <distanceradius>0</distanceradius>
        <cleanupradius>0</cleanupradius>
        <flags deletable="0" init_random="0" remove_damaged="1"/>
        <position>fixed</position>
        <limit>custom</limit>
        <active>1</active>
        <children>
            <child lootmax="0" lootmin="0" max="1" min="1" type="Animal_UrsusArctos"/>
        </children>
    </event>

For animals that will attack or at least use the AI ....

It seems a territory section is randomly chosen, and if it's chosen, then min and max is considered.

so put this line in every territory section of the bear_territories.xml (or what ever animal you are using), and it spawns every time.
Replace the X and Z cords to an area you wish to see the bear at.

<!-- bear_territories.xml New Entry -->
        <zone name="Graze" smin="0" smax="0" dmin="1" dmax="1" x="5316.82" z="9818.90" r="1"/>

If using another type of animal simply open up the territory file for that animal instead.
		
*******************************************************************************
#Changing - Adding Zombie Spawns

Zombie Hordes in zombie_territories.xml

There are 10 types of zombies. They are

InfectedReligious
InfectedFirefighter
InfectedArmy
InfectedPolice
InfectedSolitude
InfectedPrisoner
InfectedIndustrial
InfectedVillage
InfectedMedic
InfectedCity

In the zombie file you will see lines like this...
<zone name="InfectedReligious" smin="0" smax="0" dmin="1" dmax="3" x="11133.1" z="4428.73" r="60"/>

You can copy this line as a template.
Replace the name with the type of zombies you want to spawn in.
name="InfectedReligious" can be changed to name="InfectedCity" for example.

Next leave the smin and smax at 0. You want to edit the dmin and dmax numbers.
For a large horde you could do something like this...

<zone name="InfectedReligious" smin="0" smax="0" dmin="200" dmax="300" x="3583.1" z="9884.73" r="60"/>

This is telling the game to spawn in 200 minimal up to a maximum of 300 zombies.
 
The X and Z numbers correspond to the location at which you want the zombies to spawn at.

R is the radius (in meters) of where they can spawn. Locations are commented on the side. 
smin/smax = static amount of zombies, they will always spawn even if a player isn't near.

Now where to put your new zombie line of code. Open the zombie_territories.xml file...
At the top of the file you will see these lines...

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<territory-type>

    <territory color="1291845632">
    you want to place your code here, under the first territory color line.
    
Save and upload your new file and have a blast :) 

*******************************************************************************
#Making your own Custom Zombie and Presets

Using this method you can make many different types of presets. 
One for medical, one for food/drinks just as an example.
I have provided this one to have weapons.

<!-- cfgrandompresets.xml New Entry -->

<!-- chance here would be 35%, you can edit to your liking -->
<attachments chance="0.35" name="ZombieItemDropSwat">
	<!-- You can use any item found in types.xml to replace below -->
		<item name="AK101" chance="0.20" />
		<item name="AKM" chance="0.20" />
		<item name="FAL" chance="0.20" />
		<item name="M4A1" chance="0.20" />
		<item name="SVD" chance="0.20" />
	<!-- Total of the chances above should come to 100 if you add or remove items -->
</attachments>

<!-- cfgspawnabletypes.xml Replace Entry -->
You can choose any of the zombies found in this file to add your new preset. For this example
I have choosen one of the police zombies.

	<type name="ZmbM_PolicemanSpecForce">
		<cargo preset="foodArmy" />
		<attachments>
			<item name="BallisticHelmet_Black" />
		</attachments>
		<attachments>
			<item name="HighCapacityVest_Black" />
		</attachments>
		<attachments>
			<item name="AliceBag_Black" />
		</attachments>
		<!-- this calls the preset from above -->
		<!-- you can add this preset line to any zombie you wish -->
		<attachments preset="ZombieItemDropSwat" /> 
	</type>

Now that crates a custom zombie appearance, but if you want to do more.
Say you want this cutom zombie to be at helicopter crash sites for example.
Well we can do that too.

We'll use the same zombie we have been working on, so now that part is done we need to open
events and add the following....

<!-- events.xml New Entry -->

    <event name="InfectedHeliGuards">
        <nominal>200</nominal>
        <min>200</min>
        <max>250</max>
        <lifetime>3</lifetime>
        <restock>0</restock>
        <saferadius>50</saferadius>
        <distanceradius>50</distanceradius>
        <cleanupradius>100</cleanupradius>
        <flags deletable="0" init_random="0" remove_damaged="1"/>
        <position>player</position>
        <limit>custom</limit>
        <active>1</active>
        <children>
            <child lootmax="5" lootmin="0" max="20" min="20" type="ZmbM_PolicemanSpecForce"/>
        </children>
    </event>

Now search for "InfectedPolice", you will see this...

    <event name="InfectedPolice">
        <nominal>50</nominal>
        <min>25</min>
        <max>100</max>
        <lifetime>3</lifetime>
        <restock>0</restock>
        <saferadius>100</saferadius>
        <distanceradius>50</distanceradius>
        <cleanupradius>100</cleanupradius>
        <flags deletable="0" init_random="0" remove_damaged="1"/>
        <position>player</position>
        <limit>custom</limit>
        <active>1</active>
        <children>
            <child lootmax="5" lootmin="0" max="0" min="40" type="ZmbF_PoliceWomanNormal"/>
            <child lootmax="5" lootmin="0" max="0" min="40" type="ZmbM_PolicemanFat"/>
            <child lootmax="5" lootmin="0" max="0" min="10" type="ZmbM_PolicemanSpecForce"/>
        </children>
    </event>
    
What we want to do is comment out the "ZmbM_PolicemanSpecForce" line so only are crash sites
will use them. Or you can leave them in to have them in both.

If you want to leave them in skip a head to the next part other wise replace the above with this...

    <event name="InfectedPolice">
        <nominal>50</nominal>
        <min>25</min>
        <max>100</max>
        <lifetime>3</lifetime>
        <restock>0</restock>
        <saferadius>100</saferadius>
        <distanceradius>50</distanceradius>
        <cleanupradius>100</cleanupradius>
        <flags deletable="0" init_random="0" remove_damaged="1"/>
        <position>player</position>
        <limit>custom</limit>
        <active>1</active>
        <children>
            <child lootmax="5" lootmin="0" max="0" min="40" type="ZmbF_PoliceWomanNormal"/>
            <child lootmax="5" lootmin="0" max="0" min="40" type="ZmbM_PolicemanFat"/>
           <!-- <child lootmax="5" lootmin="0" max="0" min="10" type="ZmbM_PolicemanSpecForce"/> -->
        </children>
    </event>
    
Now to add your custom zombies to the crash site itself. Search for "StaticHeliCrash"
you will see this...

    <event name="StaticHeliCrash">
        <nominal>140</nominal>
        <min>0</min>
        <max>0</max>
        <lifetime>2500</lifetime>
        <restock>0</restock>
        <saferadius>500</saferadius>
        <distanceradius>500</distanceradius>
        <cleanupradius>1000</cleanupradius>
        <secondary>InfectedArmy</secondary><!-- Zombie to spawn at crash site -->
        <flags deletable="1" init_random="0" remove_damaged="0"/>
        <position>fixed</position>
        <limit>child</limit>
        <active>1</active>
        <children>
            <child lootmax="20" lootmin="10" max="3" min="1" type="Wreck_Mi8"/>
            <child lootmax="20" lootmin="10" max="3" min="1" type="Wreck_UH1Y"/>
        </children>
    </event>
    
It's the <secondary>InfectedArmy</secondary> line we need to change. To use your new custom
zombies change that out to <secondary>InfectedHeliGuards</secondary> so the events looks like this...

    <event name="StaticHeliCrash">
        <nominal>140</nominal>
        <min>0</min>
        <max>0</max>
        <lifetime>2500</lifetime>
        <restock>0</restock>
        <saferadius>500</saferadius>
        <distanceradius>500</distanceradius>
        <cleanupradius>1000</cleanupradius>
        <secondary>InfectedHeliGuards</secondary><!-- Zombie to spawn at crash site -->
        <flags deletable="1" init_random="0" remove_damaged="0"/>
        <position>fixed</position>
        <limit>child</limit>
        <active>1</active>
        <children>
            <child lootmax="20" lootmin="10" max="3" min="1" type="Wreck_Mi8"/>
            <child lootmax="20" lootmin="10" max="3" min="1" type="Wreck_UH1Y"/>
        </children>
    </event>    

That's it you are done. You now have a custome zombie with dif clothes, presets, and will now
spawn at the helicopter crash sites !

#Understanding How Loot In Buildings Work

How to know how much loot a building can spawn in and what you can do to max it out.

First lets start off with the event to spawn in the building.
In cfgeventspawns.xml you set your cords for where you want the building at like so...
	
	<event name="StaticNewsStand">
		<pos x="13971.520508" z="2826.796875" a="210.000000" />
	</event>
	
In events.xml we place our building code, like so....

    <event name="StaticNewsStand">
        <nominal>1</nominal>
        <min>1</min>
        <max>1</max>
        <lifetime>3888000</lifetime>
        <restock>0</restock>
        <saferadius>0</saferadius>
        <distanceradius>0</distanceradius>
        <cleanupradius>100</cleanupradius>
        <flags deletable="0" init_random="0" remove_damaged="0"/>
        <position>fixed</position>
        <limit>mixed</limit>
        <active>1</active>
        <children>
		<child lootmax="10" lootmin="10" max="1" min="1" type="land_city_stand_news2"/>
        </children>
    </event>	

You will notice that on the child line the lootmin and lootmax are set to 10. this tells the 
event that the building can have 10 loot spawns. But how do we know it can have 10? For that 
we go on to the next step.
	
In this example we will be using the News Stand Building.
In mapgroupproto.xml you will see this building....

		</group>
		
Now to under stand the loot functions we will break this down and edit this a bit to make it work better.
What are the spawn points ? they are lines of code that look like this....
<point pos="-1.394749 -1.274980 -1.467541" range="0.386719" height="0.746793" />

This area controls how much can spawn on the floor. where it shows lootmax="3", that is telling it
to use 3 out of the 4 possible spawn points listed below.

	<container name="lootFloor" lootmax="3"><!-- total of spawn points to use -->
		<category name="tools" />
		<category name="containers" />
		<category name="clothes" />
		<tag name="floor" />
		<point pos="-1.394749 -1.274980 -1.467541" range="0.386719" height="0.746793" /><!-- 1st spawn point -->
		<point pos="-2.859683 -1.276101 -0.142190" range="0.410156" height="1.025390" /><!-- 2nd spawn point -->
		<point pos="-2.789347 -1.275743 -1.474118" range="0.460938" height="0.777977" /><!-- 3rd spawn point -->
		<point pos="-1.553518 -1.275761 1.417546" range="0.545654" height="1.364135" /><!-- 4th spawn point -->
	</container>

The next is for the shelves and last is for the weapon placements. 

Now lets maximize this to allow you to use the most out of your building.
1st we are going to add up all the spawn points for each area. In the lootFloor we will change the total to 4
so we are using all of the spawn points it has

				<container name="lootFloor" lootmax="4">
						<category name="tools" />
						<category name="containers" />
						<category name="clothes" />
						<tag name="floor" />
						<point pos="-1.394749 -1.274980 -1.467541" range="0.386719" height="0.746793" />
						<point pos="-2.859683 -1.276101 -0.142190" range="0.410156" height="1.025390" />
						<point pos="-2.789347 -1.275743 -1.474118" range="0.460938" height="0.777977" />
						<point pos="-1.553518 -1.275761 1.417546" range="0.545654" height="1.364135" />
				</container>

Next we will do the same for the next 2 areas so when done it looks like this now.

				<container name="lootshelves" lootmax="4">
						<category name="tools" />
						<category name="containers" />
						<category name="clothes" />
						<category name="food" />
						<category name="books" />
						<tag name="shelves" />
						<point pos="-3.032413 -0.339241 0.825155" range="0.244886" height="0.612215" />
						<point pos="-2.816331 -0.310748 -0.840539" range="0.340625" height="0.851563" />
						<point pos="-2.897347 -0.320963 -1.596292" range="0.340625" height="0.851563" />
						<point pos="-2.801010 -0.309422 1.398674" range="0.375000" height="0.937500" />
				</container>
				<container name="lootweapons" lootmax="2">
						<category name="weapons" />
						<category name="explosives" />
						<point pos="-3.126306 -0.686172 0.003602" range="0.100000" height="0.250000" />
						<point pos="-1.320649 -0.383808 -1.663223" range="0.269287" height="0.673217" />
				</container>

Now that we have maxed out each area, lets count them all up. look at each Lootmax number
which is now 4,4,2 so we have a total of 10 now. that total goes at the top like so

<group name="Land_City_Stand_News2"> becomes <group name="Land_City_Stand_News2" lootmax="10">

The final code should look like this.....

		<group name="Land_City_Stand_News2" lootmax="10">
				<usage name="Town" />
				<container name="lootFloor" lootmax="4">
						<category name="tools" />
						<category name="containers" />
						<category name="clothes" />
						<tag name="floor" />
						<point pos="-1.394749 -1.274980 -1.467541" range="0.386719" height="0.746793" />
						<point pos="-2.859683 -1.276101 -0.142190" range="0.410156" height="1.025390" />
						<point pos="-2.789347 -1.275743 -1.474118" range="0.460938" height="0.777977" />
						<point pos="-1.553518 -1.275761 1.417546" range="0.545654" height="1.364135" />
				</container>
				<container name="lootshelves" lootmax="4">
						<category name="tools" />
						<category name="containers" />
						<category name="clothes" />
						<category name="food" />
						<category name="books" />
						<tag name="shelves" />
						<point pos="-3.032413 -0.339241 0.825155" range="0.244886" height="0.612215" />
						<point pos="-2.816331 -0.310748 -0.840539" range="0.340625" height="0.851563" />
						<point pos="-2.897347 -0.320963 -1.596292" range="0.340625" height="0.851563" />
						<point pos="-2.801010 -0.309422 1.398674" range="0.375000" height="0.937500" />
				</container>
				<container name="lootweapons" lootmax="2">
						<category name="weapons" />
						<category name="explosives" />
						<point pos="-3.126306 -0.686172 0.003602" range="0.100000" height="0.250000" />
						<point pos="-1.320649 -0.383808 -1.663223" range="0.269287" height="0.673217" />
				</container>
		</group>

If you look at the top of the mapgroupproto.xml you will see these 2 lines of code...
				<default name="group" lootmax="6" />
				<default name="container" lootmax="4" />

As you look through the file and examine the buildings you will notice that some of these
do not have lootmax tags. The ones that do not have these will use the above defaults.
If you want to use more then the defaults you will have to add the lootmax="#" you can either
use all the spawn points shown for that area or just some of them.

Now you can even choose to edit the categories and usage tags it has to better suit your needs.
I hope this helps you better understand how these tie in together and what you can do with them.

*******************************************************************************
#Making Custom Categories For Loot Drops

*** Making new usage tags and categories to customize your loot drops. ***

In this example we will be making a new entry for medical supplies.
This will allow us to only have medical items drop in areas we want without all 
those other items along with them, as medical by default was in the group tools.

<!-- cfglimitsdefinitions.xml New Entry -->

To make a new entry just add this..

	<categories>
		<category name="tools"/>
		<category name="containers"/>
		<category name="clothes"/>
		<category name="vehiclesparts"/>
		<category name="food"/>
		<category name="weapons"/>
		<category name="books"/>
		<category name="explosives"/>
		<category name="MedicalCat"/> <!-- New Entry -->
	</categories>

<!-- types.xml Replace Entry -->

You will want to search (ctrl+f) for medic. This will show you the items that can drop in
an area for medical. Here is one we will use as an example.

    <type name="BandageDressing">
        <nominal>55</nominal>
        <lifetime>2700</lifetime>
        <restock>0</restock>
        <min>55</min>
        <quantmin>-1</quantmin>
        <quantmax>-1</quantmax>
        <cost>100</cost>
        <flags count_in_cargo="0" count_in_hoarder="0" count_in_map="1" count_in_player="0" crafted="0" deloot="0"/>
        <category name="tools"/>
        	<tag name="floor"/>
		<tag name="shelves"/>
		<tag name="ground"/>
        <usage name="Medic"/>
    </type>

The line that shows <category name="tools"/>, we will change that to <category name="MedicalCat"/>
so we end up with this...

    <type name="BandageDressing">
        <nominal>55</nominal>
        <lifetime>2700</lifetime>
        <restock>0</restock>
        <min>55</min>
        <quantmin>-1</quantmin>
        <quantmax>-1</quantmax>
        <cost>100</cost>
        <flags count_in_cargo="0" count_in_hoarder="0" count_in_map="1" count_in_player="0" crafted="0" deloot="0"/>
        <category name="MedicalCat"/>
        	<tag name="floor"/>
		<tag name="shelves"/>
		<tag name="ground"/>
        <usage name="Medic"/>
    </type>

It is important that you replace the old category with your new one, as items can only be assigned to 1 category.

You can keep searching on the 'medic' to find more items you want to add your new category too. When you change
all the ones you want to use we will move on to the next step.

<!-- mapgrouproto.xml Replace Entry -->

In this file you will see all the buildings and objects that have loot drops. What we want to do is put
our new category to use. So lets find a building to use.

In this example we will be modifying the C130.
We only want medical and food to spawn for this object. To do this you want your file to look
like shown below.

<group name="Land_Wreck_C130J" lootmax="20">
		<usage name="Military"/>
		<usage name="Police"/>
		<usage name="Medic"/>
		<usage name="Firefighter"/>
		<usage name="Industrial"/>
		<usage name="Farm"/>
		<usage name="Coast"/>
		<usage name="Town"/>
		<usage name="Village"/>
		<usage name="Hunting"/>
		<usage name="Office"/>
		<usage name="School"/>
		<usage name="Prison"/>
		<container name="lootFloor" lootmax="20">
			<category name="MedicalCat"/>
			<category name="food"/>

		</container>
</group>

As you can see we have used all the usage tags from the cfglimitsdefinition.xml 
And only 2 categories, the MedicalCat we just made and the food category. Because we have only
choosen these two categories the C130 in this case will only look for the medical items you set and any food 
items in the game.

The c130 by default does not have loot drop spawns ( the <point pos lines ), I have included them in for you.

Again you can go through all the buildings and any that you want to use your medical supplies just add your
new category ( <category name="MedicalCat"/> ) to the building/object.

You can also remove usage tags and categories to trim them down and make them even more customized. But never 
trim below 1 usage and 1 category, otherwise nothing will spawn in said building/object.

*******************************************************************************
#Using Tags
First off there are a few things you should know about XML files.
Tags.. Every tag has a start and an end, depending on the file you have open
you will see different types of tags, but the principle is the same. 

Here are some examples...
[Start Tag] 	[End Tag]
<type>			</type>
<event>			</event>
<group>			</group>
<container>		</container>
<attachments>	</attachments>
<cargo>			</cargo>

Tags as shown above will have the coding after the start tag. When it reaches
the end tag it tell the game this is the end of this code.

Other forms of tags that don't have an end would be like this...
<usage name="Town" /> 
<category name="tools" />
Tags like these use the /> at the end to close them off. As there is no coding
in between. We will go over these types of tags later on in more detail.

5:Teir layouts
6:Economy
7:EconomyCore Definitions

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1:Basic Definitions

Name		 Class Name of Item to Spawn

Nominal		 Number of items spawned in the world at any given time. 
		(Ideal Value) Must be more or equal to min value
		
Lifetime	 Time (In Seconds) before this type of items gets deleted in the world 
		(If no players interact with it)
		 lifetime 604800 (seven days) , 3888000 (45 days)
		 
Restock		 If Value=0, Respawn item type in bulk to reach Nominal Value, 
		 If !=0, then Value=Time in seconds to respawn 1 additional item type, 
		 until Nominal Value is reached.
		 
Max   		 The maximum amount of spawns of this type on the server that is occurring 
		(or possibility of it occurring) on the server		 

Min		 Minimum number of items of this type in world, Once number falls below minimum, 
		 the Restock process begins. (must be less or equal to nominal value)
		 
QuantMin	 Minimum % Value for quantity (Rags #, Mag Ammo Value, Ammo Counts), 
		 Use -1 if Not Applicable. (less or equal to quantmax value) See note below
		 
QuantMax	 Maximum % Value for quantity (Rags #, Mag Ammo Value, Ammo Counts), 
		 Use -1 if Not Applicable. (more or equal to quantmin value) See note below
		 
Cost		 Priority of Item Spawning in CE queue (100 is default)

Flags		 flags directs the spawner, in what case it must take min and nominal 
			 values in to consideration for every item counting for spawning:

Limit Options
	child 			will randomly pick a single child item to spawn at each event.

	mixed 			will pick a single child item, starting from the top at each event until the child max is reached.

	parent 			will spawn all of the child items at each event adhering to the child's min/max values.

	custom 			uses external sources to determine the `limits`, like territory files. 

Child Line Options
	Lootmin			Minimum amount of loot object can spawn. See object in mapgroupproto for value.
		
	Lootmax			Maximum amount of loot object can spawn. See object in mapgroupproto for value.
			
	Min				Minimum number to spawn at a given location as set in cfgeventspawns.
			
	Max				Maximum number to spawn at a given location as set in cfgeventspawns.
			
count_in_cargo   Count items stored in containers as part of Nominal Value (0=False, 1=True)

count_in_hoarder tents, barrels, underground stashes (0=False, 1=True)

count_in_map 	 Count items in map as part of Nominal Value (0=False, 1=True)

count_in_player  Count items stored in Player Inventory as part of Nominal Value (0=False, 1=True)

crafted 	 Is the item a crafted item (0=False, 1=True)

deloot 		 dynamic event loot objects - helicrashes in majority of cases only by default

Category Name	 Useful for sorting, Internal Category. Name must start with (Vehicle, Static, Loot, Item, Infected, Animal).

Safe Radius 	 is how far away you need to be for the spawn not to happen or close down

Distance Radius  Distance away from other similar zone of this type. Infected City spawn zones cannot spawn 
		 within 50m of each other. Not really a problem
		 
Cleanup Radius 	 Allows objects/zombies to be cleared from an area for however long you are within the area.

		( Example - Let me explain: Let's say the values we use are 300. When you are 300m from a village, zombies 
		then spawn immediately. Once we are within that 300m, no more zombies will spawn so long as we are within 
		300m of the zone. The zombies that are within this "saferadius" will not despawn unless you move out of 
		this 300m radius. )

If you want zombies that respawn endlessly, you should set this saferadius to 0. This allows zombies to respawn immediately.

Tag Name (optional)	MUST be AFTER the category
Usage Name (optional)	Internal Category used in the mpmissions\dayzOffline.chernarusplus\cfgRandomPresets.xml file.
Value Name (optional)	Used to specify Central Loot Economy Spawning Locations

Note: MUST BE be -1 for all normal items types OR from 0 to 100 (value in percents) for items that could have something inside (subclass inside the item),
For example for bullets inside weapon mags, water bottle, canteen, can of soda..
Note: you cannot set quantmin 20 quantmax -1 it will break things!!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3:Persistence Definitions with charts

Persistence  - in a nutshell is the ability for things to be carried over across server  
		restarts, be it a weapon, a body, a tent, a vehicle, whatever. Items that are  
		persistent do not disappear during restarts. All inventory items are persistent 
		across restarts. as tents, vehicles are not in game there is no way to define that.
		Character save data including location and inventory is persistent.
		Servers are still persistent for 45 days.
		
		When players refer to an item, object or structure as being "Persistent ", what they 
		mean is the item, object or structure does not despawn or move during a server restart 
		and has a very long Item Cleanup time, or the amount of time before an object is despawned 
		by the Central Loot Economy. There are a couple of exceptions to these rules:
		
		Ruined Items are cleaned up regardless of their Persistence
		Vehicles will occasionally move or slide during a server restart depending on its location
		
		The length of time an item, object or structure is in the world before the Central Loot Economy 
		despawns it, varies based on the object itself. If, at any point, the object is interacted with 
		in any way, its Item Cleanup timer will reset. Essentially, Persistent objects that are regularly 
		used or interacted with will never despawn (assuming they do not become ruined or the server is 
		not wiped).

See chart below...
Items													Persistence
Oil Barrels, Sea Chests, Wooden Cases					45 Days
Tents													45 Days
Ammo Boxes, Protective Cases							45 Days
Fences, Watchtowers, Wire Mesh Barriers					45 Days
Underground Stashes										45 Days
Battery Chargers, Cable Reels, Generators, Spotlights	7 Days

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4:Item cleanup Definitions with charts

Item Cleanup  - Items or objects that are "non-persistence" are also managed by the Central Loot Economy. 
		"Non-persistence" items will not automatically despawn if walked away from, rather these 
		items just have a much shorter Item Cleanup time and/or may be removed upon a server restart.

Items						Time
Car Battery, Truck Battery	12 Hours
Backpacks*					6 Hours
Garden Plot, Garden Plants	6 Hours
All Other Items				15 Minutes - 4 Hours

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7:EconomyCore Definitions

for cfgEconomyCore.xml

cfgEconomyCore - It is used to configure classes included in the central economy, persistence backups, 
		 infected dynamic zones, CE logging and updaters.

Root Classes - 	 Root classes are parent classes of entities which will be used by the central economy. 
		 This allows you to specifically define what you want to be a part of the economy and what 
		 should stay omitted.
		 
		 
Attributes:

name - 			name of entity type
reportMemoryLOD - 	default is yes, this allows to turn off console messages about missing memory LODs
act - 			sets entity type (none/character/car)

If "act" type of entity is set to none (or is missing), the entity is considered to be loot. 
Make sure to properly define entities as character/car where needed since economy sets them 
up in a different way.

Variable			Type		Default	Description
world_segments		Integer		12	Defines how in many segments world will be split by CE - this affects save, 
									load, cleanup and other processing events - it's performance wide for huge 
									maps (note that default value is for Chernarus map!)
backup_period		Integer		60	Period of regular backup creation (minutes)
backup_count		Integer		12	Count of backups to keep - folders
backup_startup		Boolean		false	Process backup at startup of server
dyn_radius			Float		20	Default value for dynamic infected zone - size of the zone (meters)
dyn_smin			Float		0	Default value for dynamic infected zone - minimal static count
dyn_smax			Float		0	Default value for dynamic infected zone - maximal static count
dyn_dmin			Float		0	Default value for dynamic infected zone - minimal dynamic count
dyn_dmax			Float		5	Default value for dynamic infected zone - maximal dynamic count
save_events_startup	Boolean		on	If disabled, no data/events.bin is created at startup 
									(usefull for minimal hive setup)
save_types_startup	Boolean		on	If disabled, no data/types.bin is created at startup 
									(usefull for minimal hive setup)
log_hivewarning		Boolean		on	enable/ disable some of the hive warning messages in console
log_storageinfo		Boolean		off	enable/ disable periodic storage info messages in console (if CE stores files)
log_missionfilewarning	Boolean		on	enable/ disable console warning messages about mission files 
								   (typically sandbox mode does not require them all)

log_ce_dynamicevent	Boolean		off	enable/ disable logging of CE specific - dynamic events specific
log_ce_vehicle		Boolean		off	enable/ disable logging of CE specific - vehicle specific
log_ce_lootspawn	Boolean		off	enable/ disable logging of CE specific - loot spawn specific
log_ce_lootcleanup	Boolean		off	enable/ disable logging of CE specific - cleanup specific 
									(not just loot actually)
log_ce_lootrespawn	Boolean		off	enable/ disable logging of CE specific - loot respawn specific
log_ce_statistics	Boolean		off	enable/ disable logging of CE specific - statistical data

Persistence backups
Chernarus is a large map which contains a vast amount of objects which need to be controlled by the central economy. 
In order to do so in a performance-friendly fashion, map is split into segments which are then individually saved in 
a periodic intervals. Since most of the server uptime a segment of Chernarus is in the process of being saved, a 
server crash or other technical difficulties may corrupt the segment and in turn compromise the persistence. For 
this reason, an automated backup system has been created which can be configured by the following variables of the 
cfgEconomyCore.xml:

world_segments
Defines the number of world segments.

Default value "12" is set with a Chernarus in mind, if you are running another map with a different 
size/loot economy/amount of entities, you may want to adjust the amount of segments to its specifications.

backup_period
This configures how often are persistence backups created.

Every X minutes, a new backup of the current persistence will be created, overriding the oldest backup 
based on the backup_count variable. Minimum value "15", default is "60".

backup_count
This determines the amount of kept persistence backups.

If set to "3" with a backup_period of "20", it will keep 3 backups made over period of one hour, 
and after 80 minutes it will override the oldest one. Default value is "12".

backup_startup
This will create backup on the server immediately after server finished load operations and 
initial/additional respawn. Default is "false".

#Tips, Tricks and FaQ

Q: What can I use for an event name
A: NAME must START with (Vehicle, Static, Loot, Item, Infected, Animal) example StaticBuilding

Q: How can I change Items / Weapons from spawning in damaged.
A: In cfgspawnabletypes.xml near the top of the page use these values in 
<damage min="0.1" max="0.2" />
also in events.xml set in Flags, remove_damaged="1"

Q: I want my weapons / car to spawn in with attachments already on them.
A: In cfgspawnabletypes.xml add this to your weapon / car.
    <attachments chance="1.00">
        <item name="Name of Attachment Here" chance="1.00" />
    </attachments>

Q: How do I increase / decrease the amount of Zombies on my map.
A: In zombies_territories.xml add/minus the values found in dmin / dmax.

Q: How do I increase / decrease the amount of Animals on my map.
A: In "AnimalNameHere"_territories.xml add/minus the values found in dmin / dmax.

Q: How can I improve the FPS on my server.
A: 1: In globals.xml lower the amount in ZoneSpawnDist. 
   2: Keep total number of event spawns down as they add stress to the server.
   3: Keep over all nominals down. If you add to one item, try and take away from another.

Q: I keep getting an error in cfgspawnabletypes.xml saying "--" is not permitted.
A: Those are comment lines by the developers. Some xml checkers see those as an error.
   You can safely remove them to avoid the error from popping up.

Q: How can I get more loot on my map (weapons items etc.)
A: In types.xml try increasing the nominal and min amount for said item(s).

Q: How can I spawn items into a container.
A: In cfgspawnabletypes.xml look for the container you wish to use and add this,
        <cargo chance="1">
            <item name="ItemNameToSpawnIn" />
        </cargo>

Q: Some files are grayed out. How can I make changes to them.
A: Download the file, make your changes then send to server.

Q: How do I remove items from spawning in the game.
A: Set the nominal and min to zero in the types.xml

Q: How can I spawn in full clips/mags. Max rice, cereal etc.
A: Set the quantmin and quantmax to 100 in types.xml

Q: I added a new Category to the cfglimitsdefinition.xml but I do not see the change take effect.
A: Only 1 Category can be set to an item. Make sure you are replacing the one that was there. 
The category also needs to be added to the building(s) you want said items in. Look in 
mapgroupproto.xml for buildings.

Q: How can I make it so new characters have starting gear.
A: Console - You can have the items spawn in a container, a NPC or on the ground near your player spawn points.
   PC Users - You can edit the init.c file to set up starting gear.
For console users :  at one time we could edit the init.c , it caused problems on the console causing crashes 
and other unforeseen issues, so the devs patch it preventing us from making those changes. some of the lucky 
ones that used it prior to the patch still benefit from it. but no one can make new files using that method 
until they fix the issues and release the script files back to console.

Q: How can I turn off the weather.
A: Console - At this time we can't.
   PC Users - That requires editing the init.c file.

Q: How do I get different colored weapons and or mags.
A: Search in types.xml for "_black", "_green", "_camo" any items you come across that have a nominal value
   of zero you want to change. just up the nominal, min and max values. set crafting to 0

Q: How can I increase the items respawn rate.
A: Set the min and max to equal the nominal, set restock to zero. In globals.xml lower the value of RestartSpawn

Q: How can I have weapons spawn anywhere on the map
A: In types.xml remove the Tier # tags. You can also add usages to the weapons to include any and all types of buildings.

Q: Can I change the name of the files.
A: No. The game will only recognize the original file names. The only time you would want to rename a file is for backup reasons.

Q: Why is my Object not spawning in (Well, Npc, Building etc.)
A: There can be a few reasons why....
   1: Run your files through an xml checker it is possible there is an error 
      in the code.
   2: Verify you have entered in all the code needed correctly.
   3: A lot of objects do not like to spawn in if they are too close to 
      another object. Make sure the area you want to spawn in is clear of 
      any object, loot, ppl etc. You might have to move your spawn point a 
      little to get it to spawn in correctly.

Q: How do I ban a player or add to the white list.
A: Add the player UID in a new line (44 characters long id that you can find in .adm or .rpt logs.) 
Try the following format
Name1
Name2
Name3

Q: Why do my cars spawn in on their side, upside down or multiple in one spot.
A: The server needs time to load in a bit first, I found that if you set RestartSpawn to 150 and 
SpawnInitial to 600 in globals.xml this lets them spawn in smoothly. Setting below these numbers 
can result in what is mentioned above.

Q: What is CLE, CE. how does this effect the game
A: The Central Loot Economy (often abbreviated "CLE" or "CE") is DayZ's unique management system for 
loot spawning and clean-up. It is a complex system of tags, categories, zones, maximums, minimums, 
averages, and so on. The CLE dictates exactly how many of each item can be present on a single instance 
of the game at a time (one server), with important factors like randomization and rarity baked in. 
These values can be adjusted at any time, without requiring players or servers to install a game update.

In addition to controlling how much of each item is present, it also "cleans up" the map by removing 
items which have become ruined or which have gone untouched for a set amount of time. This function 
prevents the game from becoming cluttered with useless items, serves players with a continually refreshed 
pool of available gear, acts as one method of preventing individual players from having too much influence 
over the entire server's economy. For more information about how long items stay in place without activity, 
please see Persistence (Found in working terms in the file section).

Q: My buildings keep rotating on restarts, how can I stop this.
A: It's not full proof but try using this format X=#.# Y=#.# A=#.000000 ( 6 digits after the decimal point )

Q: How can I stop my cars from spawning in as loot.
A: The easiest way I have found is to make custom category in cfglimitsdefinitions.xml and name it "vehicles" 
then in types.xml place this category on all your cars. (CivilianSedan, Hatchback_02, OffroadHatchback, Sedan_02) 
by default these cars do not have a category tag, so just add it at the bottom in between the flags line and </type>

Q: Trying to get offline mode but there isn't any mission file.
A: Go into C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\DayZ if you do not have a "missions" folder, you will need 
to "create a new folder" and make sure it is named "missions".  Then paste the websites 
"DayZCommunityOfflineMode.ChernarusPlus" folder in there. 

Q: Can I have multiple Sea Chest with different loot.
A: No, all the Sea Chest would have the same loot. You can however as an example use different back pack 
colors to hold loot, as each color is really a different model.

Q: What is Server Hopping Spawn Points
A: Server Hopping Spawn Points.

there are 99 server hopper spawn points, 
different like regular spawn points. The server_hopper 
ones are coastal and inland.

If you change official servers, you respawn to a random 
server hopper spawn point. Always. No such thing as a home 
server and no time element. This is because they have a 
shared player db/hive.

It prevents base hopping and loot cycling across servers.

private/community servers don't need this since they 
each have their own player db.

Q: I'm trying to spawn a barrel in with items but it spawns in empty
A: You can not spawn items into a barrel. Try using a Sea Chest, Bags, NPC's or a Car.

Q: Why cant I add the Payday mask
A: They were removed due to copyright

Q: Why can't I add buildings using the mapgrouppos.xml
A: mapgrouppos.xml is used to keep track of each buildings placement for loot purposes. 
It is not used to place buildings into the map. You need the init.c file to actually place 
the buildings in. Currently the init.c file is not available for console.

Q: I stopped the server, edited my files, and restarted, but why do I still have items / loot 
just chilling and staying around? Why is it not despawning, I set them to 10 seconds.
A: Immediate changes or any changes to your files, does NOT affect already spawned items. 
Either wipe your server or just wait out till the old items despawn. 

Q: Why is my server stopping and restarting on its own (Restart loop)
A: 2 Main reasons this can happen are, 1: an error in one or more of your files or 2: Nitrado is having issues.
If you feel it is on Nitrados end, send them a ticket to get it resolved.
