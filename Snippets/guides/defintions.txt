1:Basic Definitions

Name		 Class Name of Item to Spawn

Nominal		 Number of items spawned in the world at any given time. 
		(Ideal Value) Must be more or equal to min value
		
Lifetime	 Time (In Seconds) before this type of items gets deleted in the world 
		(If no players interact with it)
		 lifetime 604800 (seven days) , 3888000 (45 days)
		 
Restock		 If Value=0, Respawn item type in bulk to reach Nominal Value, 
		 If !=0, then Value=Time in seconds to respawn 1 additional item type, 
		 until Nominal Value is reached.
		 
Max   		 The maximum amount of spawns of this type on the server that is occurring 
		(or possibility of it occurring) on the server		 

Min		 Minimum number of items of this type in world, Once number falls below minimum, 
		 the Restock process begins. (must be less or equal to nominal value)
		 
QuantMin	 Minimum % Value for quantity (Rags #, Mag Ammo Value, Ammo Counts), 
		 Use -1 if Not Applicable. (less or equal to quantmax value) See note below
		 
QuantMax	 Maximum % Value for quantity (Rags #, Mag Ammo Value, Ammo Counts), 
		 Use -1 if Not Applicable. (more or equal to quantmin value) See note below
		 
Cost		 Priority of Item Spawning in CE queue (100 is default)

Flags		 flags directs the spawner, in what case it must take min and nominal 
			 values in to consideration for every item counting for spawning:

Limit Options
	child 			will randomly pick a single child item to spawn at each event.

	mixed 			will pick a single child item, starting from the top at each event until the child max is reached.

	parent 			will spawn all of the child items at each event adhering to the child's min/max values.

	custom 			uses external sources to determine the `limits`, like territory files. 

Child Line Options
	Lootmin			Minimum amount of loot object can spawn. See object in mapgroupproto for value.
		
	Lootmax			Maximum amount of loot object can spawn. See object in mapgroupproto for value.
			
	Min				Minimum number to spawn at a given location as set in cfgeventspawns.
			
	Max				Maximum number to spawn at a given location as set in cfgeventspawns.
			
count_in_cargo   Count items stored in containers as part of Nominal Value (0=False, 1=True)

count_in_hoarder tents, barrels, underground stashes (0=False, 1=True)

count_in_map 	 Count items in map as part of Nominal Value (0=False, 1=True)

count_in_player  Count items stored in Player Inventory as part of Nominal Value (0=False, 1=True)

crafted 	 Is the item a crafted item (0=False, 1=True)

deloot 		 dynamic event loot objects - helicrashes in majority of cases only by default

Category Name	 Useful for sorting, Internal Category. Name must start with (Vehicle, Static, Loot, Item, Infected, Animal).

Safe Radius 	 is how far away you need to be for the spawn not to happen or close down

Distance Radius  Distance away from other similar zone of this type. Infected City spawn zones cannot spawn 
		 within 50m of each other. Not really a problem
		 
Cleanup Radius 	 Allows objects/zombies to be cleared from an area for however long you are within the area.

		( Example - Let me explain: Let's say the values we use are 300. When you are 300m from a village, zombies 
		then spawn immediately. Once we are within that 300m, no more zombies will spawn so long as we are within 
		300m of the zone. The zombies that are within this "saferadius" will not despawn unless you move out of 
		this 300m radius. )

If you want zombies that respawn endlessly, you should set this saferadius to 0. This allows zombies to respawn immediately.

Tag Name (optional)	MUST be AFTER the category
Usage Name (optional)	Internal Category used in the mpmissions\dayzOffline.chernarusplus\cfgRandomPresets.xml file.
Value Name (optional)	Used to specify Central Loot Economy Spawning Locations

Note: MUST BE be -1 for all normal items types OR from 0 to 100 (value in percents) for items that could have something inside (subclass inside the item),
For example for bullets inside weapon mags, water bottle, canteen, can of soda..
Note: you cannot set quantmin 20 quantmax -1 it will break things!!

3:Persistence Definitions with charts

Persistence  - in a nutshell is the ability for things to be carried over across server  
		restarts, be it a weapon, a body, a tent, a vehicle, whatever. Items that are  
		persistent do not disappear during restarts. All inventory items are persistent 
		across restarts. as tents, vehicles are not in game there is no way to define that.
		Character save data including location and inventory is persistent.
		Servers are still persistent for 45 days.
		
		When players refer to an item, object or structure as being "Persistent ", what they 
		mean is the item, object or structure does not despawn or move during a server restart 
		and has a very long Item Cleanup time, or the amount of time before an object is despawned 
		by the Central Loot Economy. There are a couple of exceptions to these rules:
		
		Ruined Items are cleaned up regardless of their Persistence
		Vehicles will occasionally move or slide during a server restart depending on its location
		
		The length of time an item, object or structure is in the world before the Central Loot Economy 
		despawns it, varies based on the object itself. If, at any point, the object is interacted with 
		in any way, its Item Cleanup timer will reset. Essentially, Persistent objects that are regularly 
		used or interacted with will never despawn (assuming they do not become ruined or the server is 
		not wiped).

See chart below...
Items													Persistence
Oil Barrels, Sea Chests, Wooden Cases					45 Days
Tents													45 Days
Ammo Boxes, Protective Cases							45 Days
Fences, Watchtowers, Wire Mesh Barriers					45 Days
Underground Stashes										45 Days
Battery Chargers, Cable Reels, Generators, Spotlights	7 Days

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4:Item cleanup Definitions with charts

Item Cleanup  - Items or objects that are "non-persistence" are also managed by the Central Loot Economy. 
		"Non-persistence" items will not automatically despawn if walked away from, rather these 
		items just have a much shorter Item Cleanup time and/or may be removed upon a server restart.

Items						Time
Car Battery, Truck Battery	12 Hours
Backpacks*					6 Hours
Garden Plot, Garden Plants	6 Hours
All Other Items				15 Minutes - 4 Hours

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5:Teir layouts

Teirs -		coastal areas tier 1, central part tier2, north left part of the map tier 3, NW Forest 4 
		For chernarus there are 4 tiers, for Livonia ONLY 3 (three) !!!!!	

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6:Economy

7:EconomyCore Definitions

for cfgEconomyCore.xml

cfgEconomyCore - It is used to configure classes included in the central economy, persistence backups, 
		 infected dynamic zones, CE logging and updaters.

Root Classes - 	 Root classes are parent classes of entities which will be used by the central economy. 
		 This allows you to specifically define what you want to be a part of the economy and what 
		 should stay omitted.
		 
		 
Attributes:

name - 			name of entity type
reportMemoryLOD - 	default is yes, this allows to turn off console messages about missing memory LODs
act - 			sets entity type (none/character/car)

If "act" type of entity is set to none (or is missing), the entity is considered to be loot. 
Make sure to properly define entities as character/car where needed since economy sets them 
up in a different way.

Variable			Type		Default	Description
world_segments		Integer		12	Defines how in many segments world will be split by CE - this affects save, 
									load, cleanup and other processing events - it's performance wide for huge 
									maps (note that default value is for Chernarus map!)
backup_period		Integer		60	Period of regular backup creation (minutes)
backup_count		Integer		12	Count of backups to keep - folders
backup_startup		Boolean		false	Process backup at startup of server

dyn_smin			Float		0	Default value for dynamic infected zone - minimal static count
dyn_smax			Float		0	Default value for dynamic infected zone - maximal static count
dyn_dmin			Float		0	Default value for dynamic infected zone - minimal dynamic count
dyn_dmax			Float		5	Default value for dynamic infected zone - maximal dynamic count

Persistence backups
Chernarus is a large map which contains a vast amount of objects which need to be controlled by the central economy. 
In order to do so in a performance-friendly fashion, map is split into segments which are then individually saved in 
a periodic intervals. Since most of the server uptime a segment of Chernarus is in the process of being saved, a 
server crash or other technical difficulties may corrupt the segment and in turn compromise the persistence. For 
this reason, an automated backup system has been created which can be configured by the following variables of the 
cfgEconomyCore.xml:

world_segments
Defines the number of world segments.

Default value "12" is set with a Chernarus in mind, if you are running another map with a different 
size/loot economy/amount of entities, you may want to adjust the amount of segments to its specifications.

backup_period
This configures how often are persistence backups created.

Every X minutes, a new backup of the current persistence will be created, overriding the oldest backup 
based on the backup_count variable. Minimum value "15", default is "60".

backup_count
This determines the amount of kept persistence backups.

If set to "3" with a backup_period of "20", it will keep 3 backups made over period of one hour, 
and after 80 minutes it will override the oldest one. Default value is "12".

backup_startup
This will create backup on the server immediately after server finished load operations and 
initial/additional respawn. Default is "false".

8: Central Loot Economy (C.L.E.)

The Central Loot Economy (often abbreviated "CLE" or "CE") is DayZ's unique management system for loot 
spawning and clean-up. It is a complex system of tags, categories, zones, maximums, minimums, averages, 
and so on. The CLE dictates exactly how many of each item can be present on a single instance of the 
game at a time (one server), with important factors like randomization and rarity baked in. These values 
can be adjusted at any time, without requiring players or servers to install a game update.

In addition to controlling how much of each item is present, it also "cleans up" the map by removing items 
which have become ruined or which have gone untouched for a set amount of time. This function prevents the 
game from becoming cluttered with useless items, serves players with a continually refreshed pool of 
available gear, acts as one method of preventing individual players from having too much influence over the 
entire server's economy. For more information about how long items stay in place without activity, please 
see Persistence (Found in working terms in the file section).
