First make sure you back up your files before adding any new code!

Looking to really customize your server to just how you want it.
Here are some tips / examples to steam line your loot spawns.

This first part is optional, well it all is but you know lol.
If you want to keep your items seperate by what they are used for
to make finding them and making changes easier use this next step.
Else you can skip this part and move on to the Definitions below.

See #adding-custom-files for full tutorial

```
  <ce folder="foldername">

In the types.xml you will need to replace the category for
each item with <category name="mymap"/> and then remove all
usages and place in the ones you want from the list above.

Example,
```
Any item that would be editble or drinkable you would give it the usage tag of "Food".

Any item that would be a tool, you could break down to what type of tool. Like small hand
held tools use "HandTools" while larger Tools such as shovels, pickaxe etc can just use the normal
"Tools".

For Guns, you basically have 2 types, 1 is "Military" and the other (non military)
would be "Weapons".

For medical items (default most are under tools. wth lol) use the usage "Medical"
and so on and so on for anything you want to break down to fit your needs.
```
In the mapgroupproto.xml you will need to remove all categories
and usage tags set to that object and place in your 1 category 
and then what ever usage tags you want that building to have.

Some examples on how this can be used.
Lets say you want all medical buildings to only spawn in medical suplies.
Well you would go into mapgroupproto.xml and in each medical building you 
would place the usage tag of "Medical". If you wanted it to also have food
you could also add the "Food" usage as well. And so on until you have it just
the way you want it.

Another example would be, say you wanted all military buildings to have 
military style guns, ammo, and clothing. Well for this you would use the tags 
Military, Clothes, Ammo, and Mags. You wouldn't use Weapons, as that you would 
assign to any gun in types.xml that is not a military type weapon.
To make sure you are getting military clothes only, that is where the usages 
for the clothes in types.xml comes in. For every military style clothes you see 
have them have the usages of "Military" and "clothes" while all the other clothes
would only use the "clothes" tag only.

Using this method you can customize each and every type of building to have 
the exact type of loot you want in it, without all that extra BS that shouldn't
be spawning there. And your types.xml file will also be just the way you want your
map to be able to use the items.

It is also recommended to remove all tiers from the types.xml they look like this,
```
		<value name="Tier1"/>
		<value name="Tier2"/>
		<value name="Tier3"/>
		<value name="Tier4"/>
```
as well as change any item that has deloot set to 1, change that to 0.

Doing this will allow you to better control the placement of items. To me it seems stupid 
to have a gun only spawn in tier 1 lets say, when the building it spawns in is in all 
tiers of the map. 

As for deloot, using the custom usages removes the need for this option. Say you want a gun
to only spawn at dynamic events, such as the heli crashes. Well you can give the gun the usage 
tag of "Special" and on the Heli in mapgroupproto.xml give it the same usage.
Or even make a new usage to add to your list like "HeliLoot" and use that instead etc.
