How to stack up multiple messages without the merging or overlapping issue that occurs at times


üí° „ÉªSource of Information„Éª üí°
This is also clearly explained in detail how to use the messages.xml file

üìç „ÉªEXTREMELY IMPORTANT INFORMATION„Éª üìç
Before we do anything let's go ahead & remove those "comment-errors" from the file
So the file is readable by the game or otherwise nothing will function in the file
‚ñ∏ At the top of the file you will find "<!--" & one at the bottom of the file "-->"
‚ñ∏ Deleting those comment's out of the file, will allow the file to be read by the game

Anything in between this (Code Block) is what tells the game
‚ñ∏ What to display on your screen, how often with delays, repeats etc.
‚ñ∏ For more info on how these work relation to the code block you create see the links above

Each "Code Block" is a line of message that appears on your screen as shown below
The more "Code Block's" the more line of messages
Use minimal so it reduces the clutter on your screen


This is a CODE BLOCK with 1 line of message
<message>
    <repeat>15</repeat>
    <text>
        Enter your message here to display on screen
    </text>
</message>

---------------------------------------------

This has 2 CODE BLOCK's with 2 line of messages
<message>
    <repeat>15</repeat>
    <text>
        Enter your message here to display on screen 1
    </text>
</message>

<message>
    <repeat>15</repeat>
    <text>
        Enter your message here to display on screen 2
    </text>
</message>

Each section can have as many "Code Blocks" as you want.
I have provided maximum up to 3 lines of messages in a single section.

Section 1 ~ contains 3 lines of messages
Section 2 ~ contains 2 lines of messages
Section 3 ~ contains 2 lines of messages
Section 4 ~ contains a single line of message

All you have to do is download the template & fill in this part [ YOUR MESSAGE ] with what ever you want.
‚ñ∏ You can remove the brackets [] or leave them up to you
‚ñ∏ You can also add/remove any code blocks from the file to your liking
‚ñ∏ Of course changing your deadline value, onconnect value or shutdown sequence to your liking also
‚ñ∏ The deadline value is set to 4hrs in the templates

Any questions don't hesitate to @ me in the thread

!========================================================================
*/


When using Messages.xml & Automated Tasks alongside Kill Feed Bots, there's a crucial factor to consider

„ÉªMessages.xml„Éª
Messages are unscheduled, meaning they're triggered by the server's restarts
The timer for these messages resets every time you restart the server, regardless of the current time
Once the timer hits 10 hours, the server automatically shuts down & won't restart until you manually initiate the restart

„ÉªAutomated Tasks„Éª
In contrast, Automated Tasks are scheduled & rely on specific times that you set
They don't depend on server restarts but rather execute based on the schedule you define

„ÉªKill Feed Bots„Éª
Kill Feed Bots offer various commands to ensure the continuous operation of your server, including automated restarts


Understanding this difference is important for coordinating various server activities & ensuring smooth operation without conflicts

‚ö†Ô∏èThis method is not reliable‚ö†Ô∏è

Using Messages & Automated Tasks Together
‚ñ∏ Are not reliable nor the timer can be aligned/synced to work together

Each time you stop the server to make edits to your files, it affects the timer recorded in the messages file.
So, when you eventually restart the server, the duration of time you were offline gets added to the timer.
This means that the longer you stay offline making changes, the more the timer gets out of sync or misaligned.
Therefore, frequent stopping & restarting of the server can lead to the timer becoming unsynchronized or misaligned over time.


‚úÖ This method is reliable ‚úÖ

Using Messages & Kill Feed Bot Together
‚ñ∏ Enabling the Auto Restart command from your Kill Feed Bot provides a reliable way to keep your server online
‚ñ∏ Even if it goes down unexpectedly
‚ñ∏ This feature ensures that your server remains operational without requiring manual intervention for restarts

However, it's essential to note that while this automated system helps maintain server uptime
There may still be occasions when manual intervention is necessary
Such as when the hosting service experiences downtime or requires manual restarts
