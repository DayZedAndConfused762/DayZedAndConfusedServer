First make sure you back up your files before adding any new code!

Remember to remove any old code before placing mine in 
(for objects already in list, some are new and some of mine are newly added.)
To find out if item/object is already in file, do a search on the name...
Ie... name="objectnamehere" search the name within the quotes.

So you know where to place the code(s) I have added a comment just above each coded area
with the name of the file it needs to go in.

For objects needing X and Z cords... You may want to use your own and or add additional 
coordinates for your object. The ones I use might not be where you want yours at, so just 
remove mine and place yours in. If you do not know where or how to get coordinates I would
suggest using the iZurvive Dayz Map Tool. It can be found here... https://www.izurvive.com/

Files names must remain intact. Do not rename a file unless you are making a backup.
The game only recognizes org file names.

Next to the  file name will be a comment,
New Entry or Replace Entry.
For New Entry - Place anywhere in the file (I prefer near the top).
For Replace Entry - Remove old code then place mine in.

**********************************************

Most of you know how to spawn in bears and wolves by now. And you also probably know
that by changing the dmin and dmax values you can increase the amount of animals
that spawn at the said location. But did you know that you can have a Herd of animals
spawn as well?

When the server spawns in a herd the number within the herd is random. So far I have seen
as low as 2 and as high as 17 per herd spawn.

To make a herd spawn open up the Territory Xml file you want to add them too.
Available files are

bear_territories.xml
cattle_territories.xml
hen_territories.xml
pig_territories.xml
red_deer_territories.xml
roe_deer_territories.xml
sheep_goat_territories.xml
wild_boar_territories.xml
wolf_territories.xml
zombie_territories.xml
.
Once you have the file open you will see lines of code like this...

<territory color="1291845632">

In order to make your herd place 1 of the following inside the above line of code.

 type="Herd" name="Deer" behavior="DZDeerGroupBeh
 type="Herd" name="Cow" behavior="DZdomesticGroupBeh
 type="Herd" name="Goat" behavior="DZSheepGroupBeh
 type="Herd" name="Sheep" behavior="DZSheepGroupBeh
 type="Herd" name="RoeDeer" behavior="DZDeerGroupBeh
 type="Herd" name="Wolf" behavior="DZWolfGroupBeh
 type="Herd" name="WildBoar" behavior="DZDeerGroupBeh
 type="Herd" name="Pig" behavior="DZSheepGroupBeh
 type="Herd" name="Bear" behavior="BlissBearGroupBeh
 type="Ambient" name="AmbientHen" behavior="DZAmbientLifeGroupBeh
 type="Ambient" name="AmbientHare" behavior="DZAmbientLifeGroupBeh
  
  
If you have the bear_territories.xml open you would use 
the type="Herd" name="Bear" behavior="BlissBearGroupBeh option

So when the line of code is done, it will look something like this..

<territory color="1291845632" type="Herd" name="Bear" behavior="BlissBearGroupBeh">

You will notice that there is a lot of Territory lines in your file. you can place this code in
one, a few, or all of them depending on which territories you want herds in.

Each territory has it's own color value. do not change this value, just add your code after it
as shown above.
