Just add in the information to your cfgenvironment.xml where shown

****************************************

I will use the Bear information for this example, however this method
described bellow will work on any animal you wish to modify.

This will allow you to better control how many animals can spawn
in a given location. In the territory files each terriory has many 
spawn ponits placements, see like this in the bear territory file.

    <territory color="4294901760">
        <zone name="Graze" smin="0" smax="0" dmin="0" dmax="0" x="6520.83" z="2770.83" r="200"/>
        <zone name="Graze" smin="0" smax="0" dmin="0" dmax="0" x="7239.58" z="2256.25" r="200"/>
        <zone name="Graze" smin="0" smax="0" dmin="0" dmax="0" x="7683.33" z="1633.33" r="300"/>
        <zone name="Graze" smin="0" smax="0" dmin="0" dmax="0" x="7160.42" z="1387.5" r="200"/>
        <zone name="Graze" smin="0" smax="0" dmin="0" dmax="0" x="8225" z="1250" r="150"/>
    </territory>

Now we know as for bears only 1 spawns in at each location even though 
the dmin/dmax is set to 0. This is because the system uses a default value.
What we are going to do is over right that value as shown bellow.

Open up your cfgenvironment.xml file and you will see this area.

		<territory type="Herd" name="Deer" behavior="DZDeerGroupBeh">
			<file usable="red_deer_territories" />
		</territory>
		<territory type="Herd" name="Cow" behavior="DZdomesticGroupBeh">
			<file usable="cattle_territories" />
		</territory>
		<territory type="Herd" name="Goat" behavior="DZSheepGroupBeh">
			<file usable="sheep_goat_territories" />
		</territory>
		<territory type="Herd" name="Sheep" behavior="DZSheepGroupBeh">
			<file usable="sheep_goat_territories" />
		</territory>
		<territory type="Herd" name="RoeDeer" behavior="DZDeerGroupBeh">
			<file usable="roe_deer_territories" />
		</territory>
		<territory type="Herd" name="Wolf" behavior="DZWolfGroupBeh">
			<file usable="wolf_territories" />
		</territory>
		<territory type="Herd" name="WildBoar" behavior="DZDeerGroupBeh">
			<file usable="wild_boar_territories" />
		</territory>
		<territory type="Herd" name="Pig" behavior="DZSheepGroupBeh">
			<file usable="pig_territories" />
		</territory>
		<territory type="Herd" name="Bear" behavior="DZdomesticGroupBeh">
			<file usable="bear_territories"/>
		</territory>

For this example as mentioned above we are going to edit the bears.
so we want this part of the code.

		<territory type="Herd" name="Bear" behavior="DZdomesticGroupBeh">
			<file usable="bear_territories"/>
		</territory>

Now to change it so we can change the amount that can spawn we add some new lines of code.

		<territory type="Herd" name="Bear" behavior="DZdomesticGroupBeh">
			<file usable="bear_territories"/>
			<!-- new entries -->
			<item name="zoneCountMin" val="10" /><!-- min amount to spawn in -->
			<item name="zoneCountMax" val="10" /><!-- max amount to spawn in -->
			<item name="globalCountMax" val="50" /><!-- how many can be spawned on map at a given time -->
			<item name="playerSpawnRadiusNear" val="25" /><!-- how close is player to trigger event -->
			<item name="playerSpawnRadiusFar" val="75" /><!-- how far is player to trigger event -->
		</territory>			
		
As you can see what I have done is changed the system default from 1 to 10.
Now at each of the spawn points decided by the territory file there we be
10 bears at each spawn location.

You can also change the global values, and player spawn radius if you wish.

It seems a territory section is randomly chosen, and if it's chosen, 
then min and max is considered.

Use the following only if you want gaurenteed spawns, if you want to keep
it random skip the next part.

Put your new spawn point line in every territory section of the bear_territories.xml 
(or what ever animal you are using), and it spawns every time.
Replace the X and Z cords to an area you wish to see the bear at.

( You might want to be quiet walking in the woods )
