			<!-- may add vanilla <container> insert above my <dispatch> (under usages)if desired -->
			<!-- i choose specific locations for my custom protos -->
			<!-- and run vanilla elsewhere -->
			<!-- or you can remove the _Custom and run both protos but it thins your loot more -->
			<!-- your limitsdefinitions, types tags, and spawnablytypes are up to you -->
	<!-- .....lootmax="???" your call, Survivor! I made and tested at sites provided but all work well on my servers -->
	<!-- tip: bags are interchangable, weapons are interchangable, not all jackets are same but not hard to play with -->
			<!-- any ammo or small tools can be switched to desire for the most part as well ->
			<!-- Enjoy, Happy Mapping!!
