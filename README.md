<!-- ------------------------------ Overview Start ------------------------------ -->

In a post-apocalyptic Europe ravaged by the Z-Virus, the United Federal States of Europe (UFSE) rises as a totalitarian regime that enforces strict control over its territories. The UFSE's power is built on the Cannabis Protocol, a controversial initiative that uses genetically modified cannabis strains to manage the infected, pacify the population, and maintain order. These strains temporarily slow the effects of the Z-Virus on those exposed, while also keeping the civilian population docile and dependent on government rations.

As the UFSE tightens its grip, factions like the Green Vanguard and the Black Leaf Syndicate seek to exploit or resist the Cannabis Protocol, while the Protocol Enforcers—an elite military unit—are tasked with ensuring compliance, suppressing dissent, and punishing any who defy the regime. The Protocol Enforcers serve as both the government’s iron fist and its tool of psychological control, maintaining power through violence, surveillance, and manipulation.

The future of Europe is shaped by the UFSE’s relentless pursuit of order, using the Cannabis Protocol not only as a medical tool but as a means of societal domination, creating a world where survival comes at the cost of personal freedom.

After the Z-Virus devastates Europe, the United Federal States of Europe emerges as a totalitarian regime exercising stringent control over its territories. The UFSE's power rests on the Cannabis Protocol, a controversial initiative that uses genetically altered cannabis strains to handle the infected, keep the population sedated, and maintain social order. The strains in the cannabis directive may well be the UFSE's most important tool—a potent sedative that also keeps the civilian population subdued and dependent on government rations.

With the UFSE tightening its grip on the populace, varied factions such as the Green Vanguard and the Black Leaf Syndicate seek either to exploit or to resist the Cannabis Protocol, which has become the UFSE's chief instrument of social control. Enforcing the Protocol, and punishing any dissent it provokes, has become the main job of the elite cadre that fills the ranks of the Protocol Enforcers. These muscular enforcers of the government’s will, as well as the iron-tool-of-command-and-compliance that the UFSE now wields, also double as the main characters in a grim chapter of UFSE history.

The UFSE is molding Europe into a region where society is ordered, using the Cannabis Protocol not just as an instrument for ensuring citizens' health—but as a way to dominate society. A medical tool is being used in ways that could well endanger personal freedom, and with it, the very survival of the ordered society that the authorities insist is in everyone's best interests.
