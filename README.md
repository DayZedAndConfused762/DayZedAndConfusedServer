<!-- ------------------------------ Overview Start ------------------------------ -->

In a post-apocalyptic Europe ravaged by the Z-Virus, the United Federal States of Europe (UFSE) rises as a totalitarian regime that enforces strict control over its territories. The UFSE's power is built on the Cannabis Protocol, a controversial initiative that uses genetically modified cannabis strains to manage the infected, pacify the population, and maintain order. These strains temporarily slow the effects of the Z-Virus on those exposed, while also keeping the civilian population docile and dependent on government rations.

As the UFSE tightens its grip, factions like the Green Vanguard and the Black Leaf Syndicate seek to exploit or resist the Cannabis Protocol, while the Protocol Enforcers—an elite military unit—are tasked with ensuring compliance, suppressing dissent, and punishing any who defy the regime. The Protocol Enforcers serve as both the government’s iron fist and its tool of psychological control, maintaining power through violence, surveillance, and manipulation.

The future of Europe is shaped by the UFSE’s relentless pursuit of order, using the Cannabis Protocol not only as a medical tool but as a means of societal domination, creating a world where survival comes at the cost of personal freedom.
